Wonderful photo, my friend
gorgeous summer scene
Wow that's very, very cool! Great image with a sort of Lensbaby effect. And a DIY camera? That's awesome! I want to try! :-)

Lovely capture, perspective and processing my friend! Have a great week :-)
Awesome! It almost looks like the effect I can get with my tilt/shift lens, great job!
