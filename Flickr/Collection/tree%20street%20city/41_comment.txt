[http://www.flickr.com/photos/photobrain] Thank you! Ya the day after I took this photo all the flowers were on the ground. Still looked pretty, but the trees just looked naked lol Hope you have a good week and enjoy the sunny weather!   And thank you everyone! Glad you guys enjoy the photo as much as I did taking it.
