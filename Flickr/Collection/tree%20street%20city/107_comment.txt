Love the magical colors and the soft sloping diagonals here.
Awesome composition Kev! The colours are brilliant; literally.

Fantastic portfolio of Baltimore! I just recently moved to DC from Europe and went to Baltimore a couple of times since! Love that place...it has soooo much photographic potential withunder. I hope I can make it there more often! Meanwhile congrats for all these excellent photos!
