beautiful, i actually like that its dark!
i must admit that when i look at it in the large size, this dark part is even more powerfull, but for the church, there are some details that doesn't appear and this is too bad...lol but thanks, it's an old take but i still love it...cos of the atmosphere, this sky was really incredible, never saw this again...or maybe i miss it !!!
