Beautiful spring scene in Vancouver! Ted Happy weekend!
It's so nice that nature provides such breathtaking beauty which helps to overwhelm the invasion of man's creations. The lighting is impeccable, Ted.
So lovely! I like driving through these streets in spring as well - love the way the trees overhang and touch each other in the middle. Thanks for sharing, Ted!
Very lovely. We have snow in the forecast this weekend...aarggh!
