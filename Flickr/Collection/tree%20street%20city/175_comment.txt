That really is brilliant Pete. Congrats.
Fabulous!
Nice shot, Pete. I was here myself in December for one of the infrequent Aldwych station tours.
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/migrandadworabutcha/] Thanks Chris. For some reason I didn't think the snow would settle in the city. [http://www.flickr.com/photos/crashcalloway/] Cheers cc. [http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidh73/] Thanks David. I didn't realise they actually ran Aldwych station tours. How do you find out when they are planned?
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/loose_grip_99] Well, in my case it was luck. A friend who has close links with Subterranea Britannica is on their e-mail group and forwarded details of the forthcoming tour. Tickets sell out fast, so I was online early the day they went on sale and got us tickets. They are advertised on the LTM website.
I agree, Excellent Artwork! <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3467/3366040009_745ddfcfea_m.jpg" /> <b>An excellent photo!</b> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/67648433@N00/"> Click The Camera Group</a>
