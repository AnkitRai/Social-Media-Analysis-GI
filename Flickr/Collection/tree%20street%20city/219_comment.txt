Oh, I feel just a bit homesick now for this grand old dame ...
So iconic... wonderful perspective!
quintessential paris...and love that you framed the buildings the way you did...and the tree.  love!!
Ripresa insolita...mi piace molto per questo!
Wonderfully evocative.   I love the originality of your Eiffel Tower shots.....
Excellent shot!

la belle dame de fer dans son crin de pierre ! je ne m'en lasse pas.
This is right on so many levels. Beautiful!
Wow!
I've never seen it like this - love how the trees seem to support it, keeping it upright. So great!

so rustically warm. and exquisite.  all the delicate traceries. like a pen and ink drawing in color.  -- <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/buzzby09/"><i>Seen on your photo stream.</i></a> (<a href="http://red.trailr.info/red2.php?tlrv=10200000&amp;tlrurl=http://www.trailr.info" rel="nofollow"> <b>?</b> </a>)
