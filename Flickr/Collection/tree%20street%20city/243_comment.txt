Do you know the group &quot;knithacker&quot;? This would perfectly fit. (They have knit &amp; crocheted and other crafted stuff there that's kind of unusual...)

If You like these kind of  things here are 2 other groups for You:  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/754816@N22/">www.flickr.com/groups/754816@N22/</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/yarnbombingukdiy/">www.flickr.com/groups/yarnbombingukdiy/</a> ! @;)
