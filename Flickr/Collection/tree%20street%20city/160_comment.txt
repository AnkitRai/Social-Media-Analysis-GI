wow wow wow ......Mexico is soooooooo colorful and interesting in their architecture. Some of my best images has been taken down there. I love all three you posted here. Excellent composition, light and vivid colors...esp the last one. You must have been in photo heaven. The last shot looks so tidy and clean on the walkway. Not the Mexico I'm used to.
All three just superb images.. very nice work..;-)
Perfectly captured essence of pattenr and minimalism...love the buildings in a row
Amazing scenes. Thanks for sharing. Looks fascinating. Have a great Friday, Renae.
Me gusta mucho ese perfil de casas
Very nice work.........beautiful image.  Have a great weekend, my friend.
Incredible place and capture.
I love the architecture of the homes - wonderful shots!
FABULOUS shot, Renae!!!  Although I love the ocean, I live near the mountains and that was the first thing I noticed...how FLAT it is there!! :-)  --<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3597/3335399250_430e9705ca_o.gif" width="1" height="1" /> <a href="http://red.trailr.info/red2.php?tlrv=10018006&amp;tlrurl=http://philmccluskey.com/projects/flickrfox/"><i>Discovered using FlickrFox.</i></a> (<a href="http://red.trailr.info/red2.php?tlrv=10018006&amp;tlrurl=http://www.trailr.info"> <b>?</b> </a>)
These are all cool but I like the final pic the most with its vanishing point. It definitely looks like you had a great time!  -- <i><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fotomakr/">Seen on your photo stream.</a></i> <em>(<a href="http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html">?</a>)</em>

Owhhh.  All three are so  crisp and bright!  When I first saw the top one I was going to tell you that you've become a minimalist artist!  All of your postings from Mexico so far have been these great minimal portraits.  The last two today are a break from that.  I like them too.  What an eyeful.
beautiful images ....
Love this beautiful and simple composition.
