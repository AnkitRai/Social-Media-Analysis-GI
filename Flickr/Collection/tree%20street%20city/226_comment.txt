Cool! How was this scanned?
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/genotypewriter]  With Flextight X5  (2040 PPI 24Bit TIF) by  <a href="http://www.digitalcopy24.de/" rel="nofollow">www.digitalcopy24.de/</a> I'm planning to buy a Epson scanner...  Thanks for the inviting to Large Format Color, I didn't know this group before.
Impressive. Which Epson?  No problem about the group. Hope to see more of your shots there :)
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/genotypewriter]  I think it will be an Epson Perfection v750. That should be quite good for the internet and smaller prints.
I use a V700 myself. I've seen online tests showing it comparing quite favourably to Imacons. Dealing with specs of dust is the main issue when scanning by yourself, for me.
