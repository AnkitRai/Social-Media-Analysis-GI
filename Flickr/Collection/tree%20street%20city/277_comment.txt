Ohhhhhh, what a powerful looking tree my friend. i used to do some drawings of trees much too long ago...and what i always came up with usually looked like this with strong muscular features....as if they were alive.  Excellent find pal...but better yet....Excellent capture.
very nice...congratulations! :)
Excellent perspective! Congratulations for Explore!
a great photo
Very pretty. A tree with words.
what ROOTS!
great shot!
I love this one -- the composition is brilliant!!  Everything coes together in them middle of that tree trunk.
Beautiful light &amp; colour!!
