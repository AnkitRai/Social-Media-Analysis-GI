Wow - see exactly what you mean now.  They are so uniform in size and colour and line.  Awesome.  Thanks for the note - wish I was about, because this is a totally amazing view!  Not in Dublin for another couple of weeks yet, but which time no doubt the seasons will have properly changed and gobbled up all those incredible leaves.  Wonderful work.
