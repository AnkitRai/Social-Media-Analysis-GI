beautiful!  Love that cobblestone street!  I love taking these trips as an older person with the ability to really take it all in.  We spent some time this summer in Boston - and experienced a lot of that humidity!  But you are right - it's definitely worth it! :-)
This is excellent Jon, love the natural colors and the soft lighting here
very nice angle  -- <i>Seen in my contacts' photos.</i> <em>(<a href="http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html" rel="nofollow">?</a>)</em>

Muy bonita esa calle empedrada.
Very cool.  The stones make for a really nice texture.
Awesome street. The light and your processing make a full image, has great depth, the stones are awesome.  One of your better HDRs.  I never heard about the protests, this year? Republican convention? about what....found this on the news. &quot;ACLU Denounces Police Infiltration of Protest Groups at GOP Convention in Philadelphia&quot; Three cheers for police stopping the lunatic fringe.
Beautiful! I really like the angle and green tones.
A really beautiful scene.....the stone details are very attractive!
Love the cobblestone streets, beautiful capture
Really full of character. Probably not to nice to walk or drive on though.

Beautiful street, nice shot!
I love cobblestone streets, they have so much character - unless you're trying to cross them in heels! :)  Lovely shot of this one!
