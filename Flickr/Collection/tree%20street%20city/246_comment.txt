incredibly beautiful street!
Wonderful composition! Soooo nice!  Christine, answering to your question in my photo, I don't think that particular species of cuckoo has the same behaviour of some of its cousins. According to Wikipedia &quot;It nests off the ground in vegetation, and the typical clutch is 24 eggs laid in a large nest built from stalks and leaves.&quot; But the cuckoos which we have in Portugal do that! :)))
Amazing pictures and colours but so pretty gorgeous  photo
These trees are beautiful! Happy Valentine's Day to you Christine.

I really like the variations of green in the trees. A fine photo.
Amazing! If those cars weren't there, it would look just like taken from some fairy-tale book...

That is a great shot and really shows Joburg at it's best!  Gorgeous!
wow awesome view ---im trying to make it to Africa this winter
excelente
wow! stunning :) must be a great place to live :)
These are my roots (no pun intended). I've never been, but both parents were born and raised in 'Joburg' as they called it. They never showed me pictures, never had any, but said it was more beautiful (Johannesburg, and the country whole) than any place they had ever been. Now I see what they meant...  This is beautiful... Great shot!
