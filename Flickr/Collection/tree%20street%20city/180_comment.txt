These are beautiful B&amp;W shots. I used to shoot an R2a with various fine lenses, as you do. But I recently traded my film cameras in for a digital system. I find that the Panasonic GX1 with their Leica branded lenses work even better than the old Leicas and Voigtlanders. If I had time and space for a darkroom, though, I might feel differently.
