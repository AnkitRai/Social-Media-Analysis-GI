<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/commentscommentscomments/">COMMENTSCOMMENTSCOMMENTS</a>  I'm impressed. I can't take night shots to save my life. This is really cool, and the contrast of the colors of the leaves and the building is really interesting.
Great night scene. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/commentscommentscomments/">COMMENTSCOMMENTSCOMMENTS</a>
