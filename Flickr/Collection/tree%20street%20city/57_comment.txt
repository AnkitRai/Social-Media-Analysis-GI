I like your green version the most :-) Awesome shot!
amazing!!!!
Fabulous tree, wonderful image, so nice image processing!!!
awesome work with great details...
great shot
First, this is a spectacular image... truly a beautiful tree!! Second, I don't think you are crazy for posting  winter shots during summer days or spring shots in autumn, etc... makes one appreciate the beauty of  every season... you know us human beings, we always think the grass is greener other times and other place... Third, I whole heartedly agree about your comment regarding cutting of trees... it is a crime in every way!!!!
what a brilliant shot of an amazingly beautiful tree!
Sieht aus wie ein zu gro geratener Bonsai, mir gefallen diese warmen Farben und das lichtdurchflutete Bltterwerk sehr gut!
awesome pic and edition!!
i like this edit very very much!
Again I like them both, super colours and detail The tree reminds me of the Harry Potter film, forget which one now! Another great shot Ben!!
So beautiful with the spring growth. Thanks.

fantastic capture! the colors are amazing :)
i just wanted to say that i agree with you completely about the western world cutting down the trees we need to survive, and destroying the centuries-old way of life for people, such as in Papua New Guinea.  it is a tragedy that is irreversible, and i feel very strongly about it.  beautiful image, and even more beautiful message.
I'm  so glad I found the &quot;autumn tree&quot; in its summer garb. Either way, the elegance and beauty of its formations shine through...the leaf colour is but the icing on the cake.
Both are stunningly beautiful, light, colour and composition. Photographic ART...White Wall
amazing tree
A superb image!!
Wow Fantastic and incredible photo :-))
Inspired tree

I love trees so much! great work!
I like the Summer one - it reminds me of the Magic Faraway tree :)
Majestic view !!!!
This tree immediately brought to mind the Ents for me, as well.  I prefer to sit on the floor or a soft couch, or even better yet, on a nice, low, wide tree branch, than on wooden furniture . So I agree with your comment.
What a magnificent tree.  A million dollar tree.
fantstico   
I want to go here
That's gorgeous! I love the 'autumnized' version of it, also! You can almost see the history swirling around this tree...
the original is also stunning great job with the autumn  colors it looks very real
Lovely Spreng Ben.... Very nice!  Peace!
What a grand old tree. Interesting photo!
Magnifique et gigantesque cet arbre.
Beautiful
What could be more beautiful to me than an old spreading tree on a mossy rock wall??? Well, hardly anything!....Love, love, love this!!!...:)
Absolument merveilleux !
wonderful image!
