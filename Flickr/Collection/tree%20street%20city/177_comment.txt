[http://www.flickr.com/photos/mochoajr] portland is a really cool city. the sun was out ALL weekend. i don't think i've seen that much sun since last summer :)
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/photographyguy] haha :)  i guess it is pretty vertical. thanks for checking it out :)

I especially love the composition and lines. Nice!

Sigh. It's already in the 90s here in TX. And there's no Voodoo Doughnuts. Sigh.
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/diorama_sky] the 90s??? seriously? it was 45 today and raining, like it was the middle of winter :(   voodoo doughnuts...? i've never heard of it, but i just googled it. i was so close to there. &quot;the magic is in the hole:....it sounds like i might have to make another trip to portland :)
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/49420240@N05]  Seriously. We won't see 45 again until October or November.  And - concerning the delightful doughnuts - you SO have to check out Voodoo.  Go. Right now. They're open late. Leave. Now. Go. ;)
The light is terrific; the whole image is fresh and clean. Well done!
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/diorama_sky] i've driven many miles for less than doughnuts :)  i will check them out. not right now, but soon. well, sort of soon :)
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/old_owl] thank you so much :)
Ive walked through here a few times in my life.  Love the shadowing (or sun spots.  Potato/potahto).  =)
Very cool... Nice DR. Great lines. I love shadows if they are well transitioned in a street scene.
Amazing shot, I love the light and shade on the brick side walk and the mixed sun light in the trees.
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/31246066@N04] that area of the city was so pretty...clean and green and aesthetically pleasing :)  the sun that day was so nice :)
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/gene_inman] thanks so much for your comments. i appreciate them. i had to google &quot;DR&quot;            and i'm still not sure i understand exactly what it means...i'll ask my personal photography expert :)
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/stone65] it was such a pretty street - one of those places that would have been nice to sit and have something to drink. thanks for taking a look :)

[http://www.flickr.com/photos/78082562@N03] thanks. it was really a nice part of the city.
