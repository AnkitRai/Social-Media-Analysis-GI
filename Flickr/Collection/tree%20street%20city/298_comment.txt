Parece un paisaje en medio oriente. Buensima composicin con las lneas horizontales y las palmas que rompen esa continuidad.
palmas con muletas, muy buena
I'm excited. What a start!
This is a great scene. I think you can tell something about a person by their interpretation of it.   Some might see this as a very lonely scene, others might see this as the trees have each other and are lonely no more.
Que buena composicin y colores ! Saludos.
Excellent.
Seeing this, I'm a bit unhappy that I deleted a group I had founded a long time ago, &quot;Walkers &amp; Crutches,&quot; about things using, well, walkers or crutches (there were just too few fitting contributions, too much junk). - This would have been a perfect contribution.
Beautiful shot!!!!! They plant palms the same way here, they have very little root yet they grow so tall, they withstand harsh climates and are yet so fragile.
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nelsonaz] Thanks. That's good to know... that means that those palms are not the best choice to resist hurricanes!!! :(
Thanks very much everyone!!!

I'm fascinated by the way urban planners / landscapers use trees so effectively as tools of their trade.  nice submission to <a href="http://thiscitycalledearth.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">This city called Earth</a>, thanks.

The place looks strangely like a deprived version of this one:  [http://www.flickr.com/photos/-dirac-/5290646114/in/photostream]
Excellent composition and uncommon subject.
