Pretty Framing . HFF :)
I see the little Smurf door almost hidden there!  I can imagine once you open the door, you will see a village of little blue Smurfs running around down there.  But they are safe because we are the only ones that know they are there, and we will never tell.  You have found a beautiful spot to photograph, Mayonga.  You have a nice fence for Friday and it is on top of a wonderful rock wall.  I like the way you framed it with the bushes on each side of the scene.  Those little flowers are an added bonus.  I like the way the building in the background adds a color interest too.  Most excellent and a little fun to go with it.  Good job, my friend.    I hope the three of you have a wonderful weekend, we are still snowed in and hoping to be able to get out in a day or so.

I think the &quot;litlle round door&quot; is a car's rim, and the owners of the houses haven't notice it is there and haven't clean it up so far. You are the best, thank you very much.  Hope you guys be able to go out soon!   P.S.: This was taken on wednesday after the Porta Johns story. hehe.
This is wonderful!  Have a great weekend, my friends.
Thank you very much, [https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimmyinto] You too
