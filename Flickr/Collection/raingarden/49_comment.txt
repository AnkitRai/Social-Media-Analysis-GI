At least the sandy soil makes for easy digging....except for tree roots!
The very top layer of soil was kind of junky (probably due to disturbance for foundation repair), but otherwise good - glad we didn't encounter clay. The roots definitely were the hassle (including all the smaller ones, and the ones from the shrubs).
