My thanks go to everyone on the site Wednesday and Thursday for a job well done. Special thanks to my fellow Master Gardeners, spouses and Yates County Cooperative Extension for their support (and sweat) put into this project. Meredith has provided a wonderful photo log of the project- she even knew the names of the plants! Impressive! Now we'll watch the garden grow and beautify the neighborhood.  Kathleen Badger
