Hello. -- Im all over the map in my interests ! Youd never know I could appreciate your photostream here according to all my flickr favorites showing. My mother was a perfectionist gardner ! So, I grew up {in Seattle} noticing this in my parent's home, as a result have a drawer of thought in my mind for appreciating every last type of shot you have in the totality of your set{s} of photos. I havent visited many {garden art-gallerys} people have worked hard to set up and maintain. But I definitely notice beautiful landscaping - anytime I see them. When I grew up - the Kent Valley was scattered farms, swamp areas full of frogs, and there was quite a few various types of other wildlife. It was spacious and {peaceful}, and beautiful, its where we (my parents) used to take a Sunday drive. Needless to say - those desirable conditions and times are now gone with the wind for that valley - and for MANY other areas around Seattle, and the outskirts, (at least that's from MY point of view). Thanks for the big pleasure of your photo stream here ! You sure covered {a lot} of beautiful areas and subjects. And BEAUTIFUL photographing ! ! ! ~ Very Sincerely
