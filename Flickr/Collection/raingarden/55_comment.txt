Have had another big rainstorm after I tamped it down and it survived that one okay, so I think this problem is solved.
Yet another storm (6/27), and I'm again concerned about the placement. The issue seems to be dripping (pouring?) from the overhanging maple. To move, or not to move: that is the question.
