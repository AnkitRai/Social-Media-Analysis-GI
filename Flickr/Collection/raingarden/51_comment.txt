Good question. The building doesn't have gutters like you would see on a house, but I'm not sure if there is some type of drainage system on the roof of the building. Here is what the building looks like:  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eridony/2660985510/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3158/2660985510_df75ce5558_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Exterior Complete" /></a>  The rain gardens will be important because the area to the left is going to be a pedestrian promenade, so it will mostly be impervious surface
