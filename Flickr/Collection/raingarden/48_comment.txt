Looks like you have a busy weekend ahead of you!
The weekend was busy with driving to sporting events! (Ontario for rowing on Saturday; northern Detroit suburbs for lacrosse on Sunday)  Filling the pit has to wait until the coming week.
After the first two hours of work, I can attest that <i>filling</i> the hole is much easier than digging it! (20 degree lower temps are also welcome :-)
