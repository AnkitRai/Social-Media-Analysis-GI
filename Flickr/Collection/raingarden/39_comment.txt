This colorful rain garden is part of a cluster of 21 rain gardens installed along 8th Ave NW in Puyallup, WA beginning 2009.  The initial installation inspired the 8th Ave NW Street of Green, which now includes a project to convert a traditional roadway into one with pervious asphalt, pavers and more rain gardens.

This Old House Magazine also joined the fun to document six of these rain gardens in their September 2011 edition.
