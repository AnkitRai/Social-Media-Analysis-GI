Thanks for the faves Hitty, Lesley and Tall.....I've fixed the comment box now - I went into &quot; Owner settings&quot; and changed the &quot;permissions&quot;  ;-) Glad you liked it Tall - I do try ;-)
My summer is the same :-)

I love how you document hidden bits of beauty in daily things like these clayton's kid...!!!!!

[http://www.flickr.com/photos/81011798@N00] YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT! BUT, I LOVE THE CLEVER WAY YOU DOCUMENT IT... IT TAKES AN INSIGHTFUL AND TALENTED EYE TO PORTRAY SUCH TINY MIRACLES SO ACCURATELY!  &gt;
