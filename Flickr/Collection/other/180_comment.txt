This design ADDS parkway width on both sides of the street. Look where it says &quot;new curb&quot; and &quot;original curb&quot;. It's hard to read. I'll redraw this eventually. I made this at night in the dark. lol
I was not tanked. I just couldn't sleep - happens a lot. Also I was reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307277194/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=stevevancenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0307277194&amp;adid=1VHR3SHVV12QXE38TWMK&amp;" rel="nofollow">Traffic</a> and got inspired.
Wait, so where is the tank going?
No tank. Just cars that look like tanks and someone thinking I was tanked while drawing this ;) I'm going to redraw it and Josh gave me some great quotes for the impending article.
Nice work.  The Residents of Haddon Ave. thank you.
