I can't believe the explosion of blossoms! Loving how those lampposts are &quot;peeking&quot; through the trees.  March Madness!!!! My two favorite weeks of the year... although I don't think UCLA or ND will get very far... We'll see if the Pope's cheering for ND or the Zags.
First!!!
Both my colleges are in this year (college and grad school). I love this shot BTW!
gorgeous - spring in PDX is the best
soo much pink   nicely captured  not into b ball.. have a nice vaca
Those darn urban lamps keep showing up everywhere.  I hope the city can afford to turn on the juice.  Sweet image!!!!
WOW!!! Amazing image here!!!
Hide the remote from your cat and enjoy the games!   But I'd rather take a stroll under these blossoms.
Beautiful capture of this photogenic cherry blossoms!
wow....such lovely colors...I am jealous now!!
Enjoy the tournament  - I'll miss your images!!  Keep that cheeky cat away from the screen unless she's there to cover your eyes when it all goes wrong!!  Byeeeeeeeeeeeee! Love these trees - amazing colour - Springing!!!!
Pretty pretty! I love that explosion of pink.
Beautiful view!
Greatest city !!
Beautiful pink. Great job.
These are gorgeous, what a view!  We have trees like this too, lots of them...in strip malls. So getting a good view ain't gonna happen. We have some in the gradens I go to as well, but no way to get UP like your shot is. Really nice work. I can't wait til spring is more than just pink though!  Oh wow, I hope Nala is well and behaves herself this year with your tv. I think we had gotten our cats around the same time...my siamese/satan mix is going to be 2 soon and is loaded up on prozac to keep him from killing me and my other two sweet furrballs in our sleep. Worst. Mistake. Ever. Good luck with your bracket! :)
Fantastic blooms Kurt!  Wow those must be great to walk through I like when the petals are all raining down too.
Wow!  Superb POV on this and extremely well laid out. Beautiful colors and just enough edges to define the curviing row of trees. Outstanding Ian.
Looks like Johnny Appleseed dropped some seeds here. Gorgeous.     Enjoy your break and your basketball!
wow - these are massive! Great vantage point! All the best with the basketball!
WOW!! That's all just WOW!!!
oh wow!!  so beautiful!  you are months ahead of us.  gorgeous blooming trees!
hahaha! great!
Great capture. So very beautiful, I love it !!! Wish you a very nice weekend.
I know it's spring when I see beautiful blooms like this... am just not as good as you in capturing those colorful blooms... have a great weekend Kurt :) Thanks for your comment!
OH wow - this is breathtaking!!!! Nothing like this around here yet ;-( We are suppose to get a big snow storm on Monday - so Spring is still far away!!  Going to finish the move tomorrow but still have lots of boxes to unpack. Will keep me busy for a couple of weeks ;-) Have a fantastic weekend!!
Amazing image and a mass of colour, great shot Ian
Wowsers! Definitely a gorgeous picture.
OK..I'm jealous..please send us some Spring!!  Gorgeous sight and capture!
Exploding in pink... quite overwhelming and I suspect the city gardener has forgotten to trim those trees this spring!  Thumbs up for the tournament!
