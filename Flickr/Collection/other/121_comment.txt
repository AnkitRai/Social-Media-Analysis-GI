Gorgeous shot, I missed snow this year but I guess you are really missing spring now - maybe it will come soon
Superb Image of this never ending Winter (in Montreal) !!!
Really like how you did this, Bruno !
Wonderful image! Have a great weekend.
This is quite lovely! I lived in Iowa for a few years, and it felt like the winters never ended there (being from Florida originally, they may as well have never ended...). I imagine the feeling is that much more in Montreal. At least it makes for gorgeous photos, right?
Terrific shot Bruno; so well done. Bonne fin de semaine  toi.
So wonderful image, dear Bruno! Have a perfect sunday with a good light for your outstanding clicks!
On sent et partage l'exaspration.
LOL!  I feel your pain, Bruno, even though we have more spring than you at the moment.  Sending you thoughts of flowers and butterflies!  :-)
Great processing! Beautiful picture!
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pifou2010]  I noticed Spring was well under way in your part of the world, judging from a recent picture (pigeon). :)   [http://www.flickr.com/photos/61357175@N08]  Keep sending them!!
