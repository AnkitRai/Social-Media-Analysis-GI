magic urban image.  [- 50mm -]
gosh your shots look stunning do you know the model of scaner used?
[https://www.flickr.com/photos/antonkrasnikov] Thanks! I love your photos too. Well i don't scan the films myself. I usually have my rolls developed and scanned by some places which provide photo services.
[https://www.flickr.com/photos/antonkrasnikov] by the way, this particular photo was not taken with my film camera. I used my canon 6d together with a modified minolta 58mm 1.2 lens.
