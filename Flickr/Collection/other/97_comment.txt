Yet another glorious picture with 'the hope of things to come'.  Is all of Boston so well manicured and attractive?
Can't wait....winter is a drab time around here.
[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sauchie45] Boston is a very livable, walk-able city with many parks, historic sites and cultural activities. We do take pride in our city, it's small enough for a strong sense of community. Thank you Robert.
[https://www.flickr.com/photos/brooksbos] Brooks, you have persuaded me that I must visit the fair Boston before too long.   After all, where else will I find so many versed in the best of poetry and living in such beautiful surrounding :-)
Beautiful image.
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooksbos] A prelude of things to come Brooks; certainly gives one something to look forward to real soon...Wishing you an excellent week~
So beautiful, Brooks! I loved Boston even in the winter and in every season. :) Such a lovely place!
Beautiful indeed Brooks but spring feels so far away right now. (:&gt;)
This really is so beautiful Brooks. Wonderful spring colour! A gorgeous shot my friend. Hope all is well.
