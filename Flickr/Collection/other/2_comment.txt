Gorgeous greens! About time LR5 added the X100s profile!   This looks like a golf course someone didn't finish making.
Canon are going to have to rethink, I've heard others say the same as you! This is lovely!
Oh how I love the comp here Al!!! Nice atmosphere!
[https://www.flickr.com/photos/izzys-photos] Fuji has my attention for sure.  The images are so very clean and colorful.  If I shot more portraiture I may already have made the switch.  As it stands, I may sell lenses I don't use very often to fund the Fuji purchase.  I have so much invested in Canon Kit, that completely divesting myself of it all would prove cumbersome and not very prudent.  We'll see where the day takes me.
Bold consideration, can't say I blame you though, I'm fully addicted to the quality the Fuji sensors deliver. Word on the street is the upcoming x200 as well as the XPro2 will be full frame and mirrorless, however they will not be compatible will existing Fujinon lenses, so it could be a while until a full line of glass is available. Much to consider.
[https://www.flickr.com/photos/pedalhead] I have read that.  If I make the leap, I am leaning towards the X-T1, making the 56mm a high priority (and maybe the 35mm); then the plan would be to wait for the weather-sealed lenses slated for release later this year.  Of course, could always go the route of the M-Adapter and score some Leica or Zeiss Glass.
