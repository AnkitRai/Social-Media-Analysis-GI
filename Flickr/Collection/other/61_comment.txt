gingko?
No.. I know for sure it's not gingko. :-)
I have no idea either, they look a lot like runner beans, though of course they are not.....very nicely captured Kevin.
I wonder if they are related to acacia.. or locust bean?
they do look like some acacia species. Nice contrast between the leaves and the bean pods.
It is a locust tree :)
@relaxing: you are correct! I did some snooping around the net.. it appears to be a thornless honey locust.
great detective work :-)
