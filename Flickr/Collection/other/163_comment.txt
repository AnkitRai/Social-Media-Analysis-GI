This dragonfly near my sister's rain garden was either curious about me or challenging me - it flitted from place to place, coming up close to me, but did not land.  I was happy to catch a shot of it on the wing - my first successful mid-air photo. [http://www.flickr.com/photos/30425804@N03/8007546246/in/photostream]
Beautiful Ellen.................
Very beautiful!
Congrats on your first mid-air catch--you're ahead of me!  I love water lilies, and these are beautiful!  The light is awesome.
Beautiful. Love the yellow colour.

Great shot Ellen - I love the colour, brilliant Dragonfly shots as well. I can never catch one
Beautiful shots, Ellen!
