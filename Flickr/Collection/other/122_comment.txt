Stunning - what a magical piece and beautiful story!!!! Can you come to New York!!
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/gaphiker] XD Thank You! One day I'll find the way... @;)
I just sent a link to your tree to my sister to help her visualize about &quot;yarn bombing&quot; as they are calling this sort of public display of knit or crochet.  I read your inspiring commentary and the fairy tale again and it would make a lovely children's book. (You could write it and illustrate it! I'd buy it for my grandtwins!) I simply adore this tree and captivated at the effort and thought that went into it. So amazing! I hope you are doing more of these; they are such a gift to observers. 
Amazing!!!
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/eraphernalia_vintage] Thank You very much!!! As soon as I'll have another story to tell I'll crochet another tree... @;)  [http://www.flickr.com/photos/marmelinhas] Obrigada! XD
