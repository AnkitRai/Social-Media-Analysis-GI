what a location for a house!  and indeed, exellent colors in those trees,   nice job on the tonemapping, very pleasant one!
Gorgeous place!
You sure live nice.
Nice Prius :)  You know, living here in New England all my life (and only leaving in the summer/spring time) -- I guess I'm surprised that trees actually change color in Texas.  I mean, it makes sense, but I always assumed it &quot;only&quot; happened up here because we got an influx of millions of people to see it happen every fall.   I guess you can &quot;color me surprised&quot;
Wow! Beautiful Trey!
beautiful colours!
I see your neighbors across the street are tired of staring at your trees -- trying to move, eh?
Wow, amazing Shot!
Beautiful, deep colors!  Nice place you have there!
Great colours. You live in a great place.
Quite glorious indeed!  Such beautiful colors...
This so nice, pleasant view.
Beautiful!
That's cool how the clouds are spanning out  like the tree branches are,  with nice colors!  Our color is white now. It's nice to see someone  still enjoying the fall colors. Even the leaf pattern  on the street is cool. love your work!
Posting early! Good morning sunshine!

You guys don't get winter down there and you are south of Dallas which also never gets winter either.    I love the University of Texas.  Beautiful campus!
Nice to see where you live!
Great HDR. Lovely house.
The red sprinkles are an awesome detail.  For me, they make the shot.  -- <i>Seen in my contacts' photos.</i> <em>(<a href="http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html">?</a>)</em>
nice shot
I know where I want to live !! awesome place it appears  -- <i>Seen on my Flickr home page.</i> <em>(<a href="http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html">?</a>)</em>
Lovely tree. Houston doesn't get such colors on its trees. Although we did have a wee bit of snow this past week.
Simply gorgeous!
They don't get a winter. .... . Not fair...
What beautiful colours!! As always..great shot!! eheh Here we still have a little bit snow on the roads. it's really wonderful also to see all morning snowy mountains around..
Gorgeous view--love those colors!!
Lovely colors.  When doesn't Austin have traffic?  So the 20 minutes thing is pure theory?  I am thinking they need to start referring to the hill country part of Texas and the &quot;traffic country&quot;...  Your HDRs are so much better than most others.
Beautiful!! Very similar to N.E. colors but all our leaves are gone by now.
This is winter??   This is what I'm used to: ;-) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/enini/3057838203/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3065/3057838203_73b7e059ee_t.jpg" width="75" height="100" alt="With eyes cold and grey.." /></a>  Great picture and great tree! :-)

10pts for the Prius!!
Wow - it's lovely :)
10 points! :)
It looks like a gorgeous place to live in.
Great shot Trey!  Love the sky!  Quintessentially a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/535761@N24/">Best of Americana</a> capture!
Yah even the car is perfect HA...very good choice...
Wow!  Going Hybrid on us.  Going green?  Thank goodness you didn't buy a GM.   You might have had some difficulties getting repairs done trying to find parts from the soon to be defunct GM company.  :)))
beautiful fall colours....
gr8 capture...awesome pad! ;)
Amazing shot Trey! Never thought Texas would head into anything like that but after seeing pictures of a friend's yard in Nederland, Tx. covered with 2 or 3 inches snow last week those colors are not that surprising. They are extremely well captured but that's nothing new from you either... To cut it short, fabulous shot!!! :)
Wonderful all these colors. -- <i>Seen in my contacts' photos.</i> <em>(<a href="http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html">?</a>)</em>

A wonderful scene but 20 mins to a city is still too close for me...
fantstica!!!
Wowww, I love the colors of the tree! And very nice light.
Fall but no winter ice and snow? Not fair! :)  Lovely shot though. Nice sky as well.
WOOSAW!!!  Thats awesome! I need a property like that!

it was -10 degrees this morning and you're place the trees not only have their leaves but are still green for the most part! I can't believe it :-)
That is one gorgeous tree - I wish we saw colors like that where I live (outside of Charleston, SC)... unfortunately we usually get varying shades of brown. Great picture!!
wow !! truly an explosion of colour !!!!
I think we have the same trees here in AL
wonderful colors!  -- <i><a href="http://www.drewmyersphoto.net/flickr_scripts/cie/">Seen in my contacts' Explore photos.</a></i> <em>(<a href="http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html">?</a>)</em>
You're blessed to have autumn so late, but then you get unbearably hot summers. Love the colours!  -- <i>Seen in my contacts' photos.</i> <em>(<a href="http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html">?</a>)</em>
Are you towards Johnson City or another direction?

Stunning colors, amazing!
I am envious of you and your family.  My husband and I have wanted to move to the Hill Country for years now, his family is from Fairy TX and we just love going &quot;Down Home&quot;.  That entire area is absolutely beautiful year 'round.  I have to make a trip down there soon to get some good shots . . . {sigh}  Thank you for posting this wonderful image!  (See, we do have fall in Texas!)
fantastic colors there ! wow great photo !
If you ever go to Kerrville you must get some pictures.
Half way up Foxtree Cove

i painted this using watercolor for one of my final art projects this year. our requirement was to paint a landscape, but with perspective in it as well and i decided to paint this!
Really?  That's cool - I'd love to see it :)
Beautiful!  I think I shot the same kind of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ruudhilgeman/4068638551/">tree</a>...
Beautiful!  Love the slow autumn.  In places I lived before Texas, the aspen are shoots from the same roots, so once there is a good autumn rainstorm, ist kaput.
