I love it Kevin. Fall is my favorite time for sightseeing and nature walking. I have a tradition of going out around Nov. 21 when most of the leaves are on the grown and the remaining ones are <a href="http://flic.kr/p/48Crfd" rel="nofollow">falling</a> right in front of you.
I just checked out your photo . Very nice!
Fall and Winter are my favorite seasons...being from Houston, Texas we don't see a lot of change in seasons...so this photo is great for me.  Love it.
Such a beautiful photo, the colours are amazing. Such a wonderful photo of a wonderful time of year...
I miss the foliage changing colors.  This is well done, Kevin.
Firery red's upon us too, will upload those later...
