we went to a seminar on rain gardens and put one in our front yard.. it's not very big, but it's thriving. and i just installed 2 rain barrels. in the immortal words of kermit the frog ~ it's not easy being green.
My friend Sally will be especially interested in your comment.  She's been championing rain gardens in Detroit Lakes as a technology to help rehabilitate the area lakes.
a lot of very common minnesota native plants do great in a rain garden. our gardens are almost entirely native to minnesota as they can take hot or cold or wet or dry and survive. it's our nature ;)
