nice...where have you found the oxalis...i can't find it anywhere...at least not Oxalis Oregana...
I found some Oxalis this spring @ &quot;Garden Fever&quot; in NE Portland.  I don't remember the exact variety, but I doubt it was Oregana.  They didn't have any Oxalis the previous fall though, so the availability seems a bit spotty.
