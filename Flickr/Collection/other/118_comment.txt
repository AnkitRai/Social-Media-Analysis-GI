Absolutely fantastic, colourful, spiritual, powerful. A wonderful wonderful idea. Thank you so much for sharing this with us all.
Wonderful. I love the way that you have woven your spirituality into your crochet, along with the colours and delicacy. Bravo! I'll send a link to my hungarian crochet artist friend, Ildiko Szabo. You might be able to swap crochet chat in hungarian! Keep doing what you're doing. the world is a better place for it. Inga Hamilton

Amazing... Quite possibly the coolest thing I have ever seen. Love the symbolic numerical nature of it. The poem/story was great. I will show my family and friends who share your beliefs, and enjoy great artistic vision.
