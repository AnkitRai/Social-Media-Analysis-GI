This grassy-leafed stuff is one of the better examples of sustainable.  Trees are questionable plants sometimes, but much of the ornamental grass stuff is pretty confined and easy to deal with.  The look is really starting to grow on me. I think the Beaverton Mall area went heavy with this style too. Even when some of the species turn tan in winter, they look good.  ____________  M. D.

I like the idea!
