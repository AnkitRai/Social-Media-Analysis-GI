I wonder if they have problems with rats nesting in these. Ive been thinking of lobbying for them, locally, but dont want to invite rats. Strange, I know  but it occurred to me that rats would love nesting here, and now I cant shake the thought.
I don't think nesting should be an issue.  Rats are typically seeking obscure places and with these being located on the sidewalk with pedestrians, doubt it should be a major problem.  At least I haven't heard of any issues in cities implementing LID.
