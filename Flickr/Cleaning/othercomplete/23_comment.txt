PLEaSE TELL ME WHAT IS THIS PLANT? I LIKE HOW YOU CAPTURED THE PALMS, THE CENTER BEING THIS VERY DETAILED YELLOW? I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO CALL IT.
Darrin, this palm is in a little garden near my work, it belongs to the nuseum of Macau. I don't know the name of the tree. I think this tree does not grow very much or is still very young...  I do not know much about it as you see.  Nice to see you, my friend:   Have a nice day and thank you.  :)
Wonderful ! I give you a  From the FLOWER-POWER Group
