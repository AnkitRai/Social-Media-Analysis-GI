This is odd to me. I went to OLGH for 8 years. While there was always flooding in the neighborhood (I actually though the slag made the earth less able to accept the water). But the parking lot/playground was usually passable. I don't think I ever saw it this flooded. Basements always flooded, but the church never was flooded that I remember. Its ground was at about sea level I think.  I hear the school is shut down.
