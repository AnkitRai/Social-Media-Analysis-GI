Gorgeous greens! About time LR5 added the X100s profile!   This looks like a golf course someone didn't finish making.
Canon are going to have to rethink, I've heard others say the same as you! This is lovely!
Oh how I love the comp here Al!!! Nice atmosphere!

Bold consideration, can't say I blame you though, I'm fully addicted to the quality the Fuji sensors deliver. Word on the street is the upcoming x200 as well as the XPro2 will be full frame and mirrorless, however they will not be compatible will existing Fujinon lenses, so it could be a while until a full line of glass is available. Much to consider.
