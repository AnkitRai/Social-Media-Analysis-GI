beautiful light in this image  Comment on my Stream
Really nice oranges behind the tree.  It's great the the tree is well lit even with so much light behind it.  Comment on my Stream
This is a pretty night scene. The sky has some interesting color and makes it almost seem like it's day time. The shadows make for some neat lines in this. I think the photo is a little too bsuy: there's a lot going on in the lower portion of this photo and it's ahrd to see what exactly that is. Love the tree though!

beautiful colors in your nightshot(s), the black border adds to the photo here, the light on the ground is a bit too much in contrast with the rest I think  ** Score 8/10 from the 10 to 1 - Post one, score AND COMMENT on 10 Group **

Great shot! I think the framing here is excellent. I love how the tree sorta melts into the frame. I think the bottom of the picture is a tad underwhelming, but still very cool!   Comment on my Stream
plus:great scenic impact ___ minus: a bit overexpo in some areas___  (from the Plus-Minus Comment group)
plus: Looks wonderful, I like the Lights and the Tree.  The Composition is just great!   minus: Im sorry, theres noting negative on this Picture in my Eyes...I love this one ;)  (from the Plus-Minus Comment group)
Plus: Lighting, composition.  Minus: Borders
Plus: The lighting here is fantastic. I think that you've really brought out the mood in this picture. Great picture!  Minus: The borders don't work for me. I would have personally preferred the borders to be limited to only the top and bottom and not sides; if at all. Then again, this is my opinion. I'm sure you had your reasons.  (I hope the admins are happy with this intricate bit of commentary. If Not, I'm sure you can bend over elsewhere.)
