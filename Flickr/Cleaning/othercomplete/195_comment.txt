look at the bokeh!
So happy for you. Can't wait to see it in full bloom. Can you believe I am going to see my first proper winter in nearly 2 years?? Sad about leaving Singapore but we are going to have winter (albeit it is no where near as cold as yours....).
You sure captured some great bokeh and spot on focus!
