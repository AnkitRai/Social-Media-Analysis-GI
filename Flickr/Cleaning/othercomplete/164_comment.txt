i like them but what are they?  are they sharp?  do they have a smell? are those buds that open up? mystery.
I think they're seed pods. Ovaries.
they look like St. John's-wort...
so used as an herbal anti-depressant (at least in Germany).
indeed, bur everywhere else also. I pick the flowers when it is very sunny (see  here  and macerate them in a good organic sunflower oil for a month,. It turns the oil red (!) and it is excellent as a rub for my back aches.
