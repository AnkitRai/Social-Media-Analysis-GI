Those are the swampy water-loving plants?  I don't know much about those.  Where's the plant key?  Inquiring minds.....
The plant key is off on the right (unscanned) side of the paper :^)   The goal of a rain garden is to help absorb the first flush that comes off an impermeable surface (e.g. roof) and keep it out of the storm water system. It won't necessarily stay swampy. With the well-draining soil and since this spot gets a lot of sun, we'll put plants that can deal with wet conditions near where the water enters, but past that it is plants that can do well either wet or dry.   bf iris: blue flag iris RTD: red twig dogwood (shrub) wild ger: wild geranium c.a.: canada anemone ?? - rattlesnake master b.e.sue: black-eyed susan cone: purple coneflowers also going to have wild strawberries (all over) and nodding wild onions (on the slope)
