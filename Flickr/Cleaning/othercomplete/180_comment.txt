This design ADDS parkway width on both sides of the street. Look where it says new curb and original curb. It's hard to read. I'll redraw this eventually. I made this at night in the dark. lol
I was not tanked. I just couldn't sleep - happens a lot. Also I was reading Traffic and got inspired.
Wait, so where is the tank going?
No tank. Just cars that look like tanks and someone thinking I was tanked while drawing this ;) I'm going to redraw it and Josh gave me some great quotes for the impending article.
Nice work.  The Residents of Haddon Ave. thank you.
