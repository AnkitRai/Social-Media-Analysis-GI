There is a hugh magnolia in Balboa Park in SD, which I contemplated taking a photo, but then thought to myself that I don't have a big enough camera. :)","15"

"I wouldn[t say it's two shots ... marvelous oasis !","15"
"Its so important to leave green space but alas, but many developers do not take this into account. Of course the price of city centre land has probably something to do with this! This looks a wonderful place in the middle of your city Jim.","15"

"Many people here in Australia think the Jacaranda is a native to Australia because they grow so well here and are very popular. I once collected seeds and grow them and they all developed into beautiful trees. Mind you I could not keep them in a small backyard. One eventually ended up in my neighbour's backyard. I will have to show you a pic of it. The Jacaranda is that popular here in Australia that there is a festival callled naturally enough The Jacaranda Festival also not far from where I live is Jacaranda Avenue and every street tree is a Jacaranda. :))","58"

"I see the little Smurf door almost hidden there!  I can imagine once you open the door, you will see a village of little blue Smurfs running around down there.  But they are safe because we are the only ones that know they are there, and we will never tell.  You have found a beautiful spot to photograph, Mayonga.  You have a nice fence for Friday and it is on top of a wonderful rock wall.  I like the way you framed it with the bushes on each side of the scene.  Those little flowers are an added bonus.  I like the way the building in the background adds a color interest too.  Most excellent and a little fun to go with it.  Good job, my friend.    I hope the three of you have a wonderful weekend, we are still snowed in and hoping to be able to get out in a day or so.","84"

". Thanks for your interest and comment, Father Hinie, much appreciated.  I completely agree with what you say, the picture draws you in as if you were there, which is even more noticeable for larger size versions.   The light was very tricky, as most of the promenade was in marked shadows while very bright summer sunlight was filtering here and there, which made for a proper exposure nightmare due to the extreme dynamic range but in the end the attempt mostly succeeded. .","201"

"Bonita composio de uma cena bem caracterstica.   O ponto de tomada de vista e a luz dourada do entardecer, a permitir ver desde o grupo que goza o momento do tempo e da cavaqueira (no sei se esta tem o mesmo significado por a) at a um horizonte belo e abrangendo um outro mundo mais vasto do que o da rua que desce por entre as rvores, oferecendo ao observador a possibilidade de espraiar o olhar e, ao mesmo tempo, observar todas estas componentes. Gostei e recorda-me tempos em que nas noites quentes de vero se gozava este prazer da conversa na rua e o passagem do tempo ainda no tinha sido afectada pelo stress de quem hoje vive nas cidades.","202"

"Wonderful composition! Soooo nice!  Christine, answering to your question in my photo, I don't think that particular species of cuckoo has the same behaviour of some of its cousins. According to Wikipedia It nests off the ground in vegetation, and the typical clutch is 24 eggs laid in a large nest built from stalks and leaves. But the cuckoos which we have in Portugal do that! :)))","241"

They never showed me pictures, never had any, but said it was more beautiful (Johannesburg, and the country whole) than any place they had ever been. Now I see what they meant...

"Nature and art, they seem to shun each other Yet in a trice can draw back close once more; The aversions gone too that I felt before, Both equally attract me, I discover. An honest efforts all that we require! Only when weve assigned art clear-cut hours, With full exertion of our mental powers, Is nature free our hearts once more to inspire. Such is the case with all forms of refinement: In vain will spirits lacking due constraint Seek the perfection of pure elevation. He whod do great things must display restraint; The master shows himself first in confinement, And law alone can grant us liberation.  Goethe's sonnet about nature and art ","261"
