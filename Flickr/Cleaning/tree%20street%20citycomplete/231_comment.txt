Beautiful tree! Great shot!
Beautifully done.....A fabulous peek through the tree.  It has shed nearly all it's Autumn leaves now.. Great composition my friend. Try not to worry too much about the coming weeks......take one day at a time. Soon it will all be over and you can get back to normal. I will be thinking of you. Tricia.
