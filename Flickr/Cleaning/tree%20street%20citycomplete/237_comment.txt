Lovely shot, CG.  I am looking forward to the day when they curtail the hoardings.
Thanks Pandiyan. As an advertising guy myself, I don't mind hte hoardings too much. But I know what you mean...
Well its curtains for the hoarding now...
Yeah.  And, though I think it is a hasty decision, it has paid off. I can see trees. AGAIn
Its true it has paid of so long.  See how ong it might take for them to crop up again...  Note: We have a election coming up quiet soon..
