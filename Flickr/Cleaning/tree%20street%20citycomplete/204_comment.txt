Beautiful!  It just draws you in.
. Thanks for your interest and comment, Father Hinie, much appreciated.  I completely agree with what you say, the picture draws you in as if you were there, which is even more noticeable for larger size versions.   The light was very tricky, as most of the promenade was in marked shadows while very bright summer sunlight was filtering here and there, which made for a proper exposure nightmare due to the extreme dynamic range but in the end the attempt mostly succeeded. .
