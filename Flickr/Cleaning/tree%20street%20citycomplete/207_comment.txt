Beautiful perspective!
Chris, las he visto de todos los colores, pero de ese precisamente, n. Es muy bonito y recuerda al color de la jacaranda..
beautiful,  looks like jacaranda
I love the color you have captured! It's a beautiful jacarand tree! The lavender and green of the tree pales against the blue sky, but the building provides an alternative contrasting background.  The use of the roof line to diagonally divide the image in the composition is excellent.
