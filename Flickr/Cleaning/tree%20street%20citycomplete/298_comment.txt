Parece un paisaje en medio oriente. Buensima composicin con las lneas horizontales y las palmas que rompen esa continuidad.
palmas con muletas, muy buena
I'm excited. What a start!
This is a great scene. I think you can tell something about a person by their interpretation of it.   Some might see this as a very lonely scene, others might see this as the trees have each other and are lonely no more.
Que buena composicin y colores ! Saludos.
Excellent.
Seeing this, I'm a bit unhappy that I deleted a group I had founded a long time ago, Walkers  Crutches, about things using, well, walkers or crutches (there were just too few fitting contributions, too much junk). - This would have been a perfect contribution.
Beautiful shot!!!!! They plant palms the same way here, they have very little root yet they grow so tall, they withstand harsh climates and are yet so fragile.

Thanks very much everyone!!!

I'm fascinated by the way urban planners / landscapers use trees so effectively as tools of their trade.  nice submission to This city called Earth, thanks.
Meravigliosa!

The place looks strangely like a deprived version of this one:  
Excellent composition and uncommon subject.
