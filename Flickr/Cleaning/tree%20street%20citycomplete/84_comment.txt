Looks like a magical place - have a great weekend

This is such a pretty shot! Hope you have a great weekend!

Pretty Framing . HFF :)
I see the little Smurf door almost hidden there!  I can imagine once you open the door, you will see a village of little blue Smurfs running around down there.  But they are safe because we are the only ones that know they are there, and we will never tell.  You have found a beautiful spot to photograph, Mayonga.  You have a nice fence for Friday and it is on top of a wonderful rock wall.  I like the way you framed it with the bushes on each side of the scene.  Those little flowers are an added bonus.  I like the way the building in the background adds a color interest too.  Most excellent and a little fun to go with it.  Good job, my friend.    I hope the three of you have a wonderful weekend, we are still snowed in and hoping to be able to get out in a day or so.

This is wonderful!  Have a great weekend, my friends.
Thank you very much, 
Lindas cores nesta excelente imagem!! Hugs.
