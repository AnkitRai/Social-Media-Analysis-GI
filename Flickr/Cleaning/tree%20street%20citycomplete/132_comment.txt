oh yes --- finally! :-) The blossoms are gorgeous!
Bragger! :p  Lovely shot.
I thought of another word that starts with B and ends with tard but it wouldn't be nice :) Take a look at my shots from today and you'll see why :P  When I lived in Vancouver it gave me great joy every February to call my friends back here and tell them about walking around in shirtsleeves and looking at the first Crocus of the year-this is the photo equivalent :)
Yeah, I thought winter was over here in Toronto too. We had a few warm days recently, but today received a few centimetres of snow =(
I went away for a week, and this has happened, I have to get downtown.  Beautiful.
I can't wait to see them at burrard station !!
Wow
I had to get out to see them yesterday... spring is really springing!

nice one
