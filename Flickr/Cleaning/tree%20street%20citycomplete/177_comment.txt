Beautiful lighting, nice!
I like this!
I love how this image screams vertical. Great job!
nice light
nice




I especially love the composition and lines. Nice!

Sigh. It's already in the 90s here in TX. And there's no Voodoo Doughnuts. Sigh.


The light is terrific; the whole image is fresh and clean. Well done!


Ive walked through here a few times in my life.  Love the shadowing (or sun spots.  Potato/potahto).  =)
Very cool... Nice DR. Great lines. I love shadows if they are well transitioned in a street scene.
Amazing shot, I love the light and shade on the brick side walk and the mixed sun light in the trees.



great capture love the color
