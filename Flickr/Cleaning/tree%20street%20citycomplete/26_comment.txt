What a wonderful street you have, love that the Christmas cheer is alive and well in your area. Fantastic photo, Dave!
nice photos series
Wonderful image!
Beautiful Christmas tree lights on these bare trees; the street lights also enhance the scene with adding some extra oomph to the darkened street scene.  The snow along the walkway makes it look really wintery now and overall it is becoming of a really lovely Christmas and Holiday scene.  Very well captured, dear Dave, and quite lovely.  Could eaisly be used as a card or in a calendar.
Beautiful shot Dave!  Love the blue hour sky!
Thank you all so very much!
Beautiful capture and full of Christmas atmosphere with beautiful colors. Congratulations, Dave.!!
