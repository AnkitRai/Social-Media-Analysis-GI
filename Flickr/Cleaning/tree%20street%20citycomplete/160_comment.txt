Excellent composition, light and vivid colors...esp the last one. You must have been in photo heaven. The last shot looks so tidy and clean on the walkway. Not the Mexico I'm used to.
All three just superb images.. very nice work..;-)
Perfectly captured essence of pattenr and minimalism...love the buildings in a row
Amazing scenes. Thanks for sharing. Looks fascinating. Have a great Friday, Renae.

FABULOUS shot, Renae!!!  Although I love the ocean, I live near the mountains and that was the first thing I noticed...how FLAT it is there!! :-)  -- Discovered using FlickrFox. ( ? )

Owhhh.  All three are so  crisp and bright!  When I first saw the top one I was going to tell you that you've become a minimalist artist!  All of your postings from Mexico so far have been these great minimal portraits.  The last two today are a break from that.  I like them too.  What an eyeful.
beautiful images ....
Love this beautiful and simple composition.
Wonderful sparse first photo!  Love the colors in the others!!
GREAT series!
