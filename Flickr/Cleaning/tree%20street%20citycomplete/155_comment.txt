beautiful!
Whoa!
That can't have been easy to do.
That. Is. Awesome.  Maybe they were trying to protect their bike from bike-riding bears.
That's convenient :)
great shot!
nice! :)
great shot, love the tones. I just got a few rolls of this film, did you use a red filter?
interesting scene, nice shot
Thanks everyone!!  @ rich.steinbach - Thanks! It was fun meeting you the other day by the way. I keep meaning to stop by your store at some point, but for whatever reason, I don't get over to that part of town too often. But anyway, no I didn't use a red filter, although it does kind of look like I did.
Beautifully captured.   I'm glad to see that the Baltimore bike trees are bearing fruit.
Another great one. I like how the bike breaks the symmetry. Also the color of the leaves (yellow?)
@ tuning slide -  Thanks! Yes, the leaves were a very nice yellow.
heheh. love it.
Hmm, that's different. Definitely photo worthy!
great topic, great treatment, great square!
surreal and awesome
When you come to a fork in the road, take it.   --  Yogi Berra   Great image !
Ever so droll!  And beautifully exposed.
One way to stop your bike getting pinched:)  Great take!
Great one!

Quirky as all get out!
strange how the leaves almost seem like paper cut-outs -- but the bike  tree trunk are so very real...

Oh, a bicycle tree and it's yielding fruit! Please add it here my dear: - Two wheels on the drift -.
