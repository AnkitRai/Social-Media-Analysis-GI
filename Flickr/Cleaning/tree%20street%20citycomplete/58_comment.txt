Many people here in Australia think the Jacaranda is a native to Australia because they grow so well here and are very popular. I once collected seeds and grow them and they all developed into beautiful trees. Mind you I could not keep them in a small backyard. One eventually ended up in my neighbour's backyard. I will have to show you a pic of it. The Jacaranda is that popular here in Australia that there is a festival callled naturally enough The Jacaranda Festival also not far from where I live is Jacaranda Avenue and every street tree is a Jacaranda. :))
