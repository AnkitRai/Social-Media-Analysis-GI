a happy ending?
The end is near
Amazing, apocalyptic lighting. Love every pixel.
spectacular, I had a very strong bodily reaction when I saw this. A deep feeling of unease. I guess it is the tension between the sign and the frantic (continued) movement in the tree. I hope to see this on a novel cover one day. Perhaps something by James Ellroy.
Magnifique!
Good
Ah Damn! Five stars for this one! Sometimes I wish there was a differentiation between the fave function and some kind of my vote for real artistic merit function.
