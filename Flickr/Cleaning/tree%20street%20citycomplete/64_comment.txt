Very good composition with the contrast of the colors. Well done Osvaldo.
Fantstica!  Infelizmente, o tempo segue o seu ritmo e, para ns, uma semana parece pouco para durar tanta beleza. O curioso  que, apesar de tambm termos flores amarelas,  uma cor que associamos mais ao Outono. Boa composio, as cores conjugam muito bem com as da rvore. Abrao
beautiful...superb colour...wooo

Wow, it's a beautiful tree, the yellow leaves look great against the blue sky, and I love the color of that wall too, beautiful composition! have a good week, Osvaldo, and thanks for the comments!
It's a very eyecatching tree O and the warm tones in the fence below really add to the composition. When you see them in bloom you have to photograph them or possibly risk missing the opportunity :)
Very beautiful yellow against the blue sky ! Excellent shot !

Great shot!  Nearly an unnatural colour for a tree's blossom, but that makes it so special. Very shiny and happy at least.
