Lovely picture, but it is a litle dark Score _7/10 (from the Score Me! group)
I like this tree, especially against the sky.  The little object I put the note on is a distraction, and there's a little snippet of sidewalk farther down that also seems out of place.  Score 6.5/10 (from the Score Me! group)
Lovely tree silhouette! The World Through My Eyes
I'm sorry, but I just don't get the appeal of this...,  .....rather, ordinary tree !!  Score 5/10 (from the Score Me! group)
Score _6/10 (from the Score Me!  group)  I like the tree and the street near by. The way is growing as it's wedged up between two roads. But I found the frame too tight on the subject and there are two little things disturbing me on the very left of the picture.
Lovely blue sky but a little dark  Score 6/10
