"Any idea what was originally planted here and why it failed?","1"
"I think a harsh winter and nearby construction did it. I believe this site is now replanted and healthy","1"
"looks like good construction quality","2"
"nice bioretention planting. do you know if these need to be replanted each year?","3"
"Those are perennials and should come back each year.  Shouldn't need replacing, only annual maintenance to remove sediment buildup.","3"
"I wonder if they have problems with rats nesting in these. Ive been thinking of lobbying for them, locally, but dont want to invite rats. Strange, I know  but it occurred to me that rats would love nesting here, and now I cant shake the thought.","4"
"I don't think nesting should be an issue.  Rats are typically seeking obscure places and with these being located on the sidewalk with pedestrians, doubt it should be a major problem.  At least I haven't heard of any issues in cities implementing LID.","4"
"Interesting curb face.","5"
"All the new construction in the downtown area was using granite for the curbs.  Saw the same thing in DC last weekend.  Definitely won't deteriorate like concrete.","5"
"Is the curb on the street side cut to allow street water to flow into the bioswale?  Also, is the sidewalk graded to direct water to the channels?    I don't think their bioswale has to survive winters/significant snow and ice/salt; must be nice to be Oregon.","6"
"So I forgot to get a photo of that, but according to this brochure from Portland, water does enter from the street.   I don't know if the sidewalk has a slope.  CDOT built a huge bioswale and permeable parking lot at Des Plaines north of Taylor Street. It's parking for the Maxwell Street Market. I have a photo but I haven't uploaded it yet.","6"
"Don't you need flush kerbing to maximise permeability?  The idea is to facilitate stormwater flow to trap any chemicals/nutrients in the runoff before the water gets discharged off-sites into other drainage channels...","6"
"@PSeangsong: Check the notes for details. The flush curbing is at the far end of the bioswale. I should have walked all around it to get better photos as this is the first neighborhood, small-scale bioswale I've ever seen in person.","6"
"My sons' school has a bioswale. Until this time, I did not know this type of management had a name.   facilities.pps.k12.or.us/.docs/pg/11054","6"
"I just blogged this photo in an article about Philadelphia's new stormwater management plan, on Steven can plan.","6"
"Hi, I'm an admin for a group called Rain Gardens, Rain Barrels  More, and we'd love to have this added to the group! Wonderful shot!","7"
"So beautiful!  I am enjoying this whole series of photos.","8"

"I saw your beautiful work in: Ho ammirato questo tuo lavoro in: ","8"
"Streets should be for staying in, and not just for moving through a great concept. And it it's possible to combine these two (like the Avenue des Champs-Elyses in Paris can be an example of) you have created a great urban place.","9"
"Very much looking forward to seeing how these develop. I am skeptical about:  1) short term maintenance - trash, dogshit, etc. 2) long term maintenance - replacing the sand once it becomes clogged every few years 3) re-educating DPW staff and the general public about these things. 4) standing water and mosquitos 5) the unknown unknowns - what happens when you infiltrate a bunch of water in medium sized point sources all over the city? sinkholes? flooded basements? green slime that reacts to human emotion? nothing? (alright, I'm actually excited by the chaotic implications, sometimes)","10"
"All valid points, of course. I don't know enough to answer them one way or another. But...  1) Dog shit is biodegradable, and will be mixed in with far more, less-toxic material, so that doesn't strike me as a huge deal, but I could be wrong. And I think the hope is that these will become little community spaces, and that someone will take ownership of them in some way, even if it's just picking out the obvious trash. Maybe that's wishful thinking, but even the most fanciful vision of street-level bioswales would include two per block, at most. It seems to me that SOMEONE would be motivated enough to at least pick up trash periodically from such small spaces. Just my opinion. You'll notice, however, that one of the bioswales has its input point blocked by...something (I didn't investigate).  2) Honest question: Does this even need to be done? If everything that washes into these bioswales is particulate matter, won't it just become part of the bioswale? Again, I'm just learning about this, so I could be completely off-base.  3) Absolutely agreed.   4) How long does water have to be standing before it attracts mosquitoes? Seems to me like the water would infiltrate long before that would be a concern.  5) These are the big questions, and obviously I have no idea. The city was engineered to carry water away from roads and homes as quickly as possible for a reason. That's not to say we can't/shouldn't find ways of naturalizing the process, just that we shouldn't forget why we built billions of dollars worth of sewer infrastructure in the first place.  Also, I'm worried about what this means long-term for development. I'm a Smart Growth guy, so I want Baltimore to be as densely as possible (while obviously allowing for well-planned green space). But once a huge vacant lot like the one at Baltimore  Mount is turned into a rain garden, does that take it off the development table forever?   What if the neighborhood rebounds to the point that someone wants to build something there - I'd say that'd be a good thing, but I think a lot of people would see that as giving our green space to developers. Even if we required that new development meet the level of SWM it currently achieves with the bioswale - will that be enough for people to be okay with it? Same goes for community gardens.   I'm not saying that every currently vacant site needs to be developed, even if that were economically feasible; but the conflict is bound to arise at some point, and I think it's a conversation worth having now.","10"

"This grassy-leafed stuff is one of the better examples of sustainable.  Trees are questionable plants sometimes, but much of the ornamental grass stuff is pretty confined and easy to deal with.  The look is really starting to grow on me. I think the Beaverton Mall area went heavy with this style too. Even when some of the species turn tan in winter, they look good.  ____________  M. D.

"Hi,  My name is Meng Cao, from the School of Design, University of Pennsylvania. Im a second-year graduate student pursuing Master of City Planning, with the concentration of Urban Design. Last semester, we had a course called Urban Design and Research Methods. The professor, Stefan Al, asked us to collect good urban design works. So with the endeavor of the whole class, we collected 45 works and we are hoping to publish a small book to show all these excellent works in a Patent Style. The Rain Garden in Parking Lot is considered a great urban design idea. We are hoping to incorporate it in the book, but we need to use the photo above, so Im writing to you to ask if we can use this photo.  Thank you very much for supporting our Urban Design Patent Book. I look forward to hearing from you! And my email address is mengcao@design.upenn.edu.  Sincerely,  Meng Cao","38"
