Is the curb on the street side cut to allow street water to flow into the bioswale?  Also, is the sidewalk graded to direct water to the channels?    I don't think their bioswale has to survive winters/significant snow and ice/salt; must be nice to be Oregon.
So I forgot to get a photo of that, but according to this brochure from Portland, water does enter from the street.   I don't know if the sidewalk has a slope.  CDOT built a huge bioswale and permeable parking lot at Des Plaines north of Taylor Street. It's parking for the Maxwell Street Market. I have a photo but I haven't uploaded it yet.
Don't you need flush kerbing to maximise permeability?  The idea is to facilitate stormwater flow to trap any chemicals/nutrients in the runoff before the water gets discharged off-sites into other drainage channels...
@PSeangsong: Check the notes for details. The flush curbing is at the far end of the bioswale. I should have walked all around it to get better photos as this is the first neighborhood, small-scale bioswale I've ever seen in person.
My sons' school has a bioswale. Until this time, I did not know this type of management had a name.   facilities.pps.k12.or.us/.docs/pg/11054
I just blogged this photo in an article about Philadelphia's new stormwater management plan, on Steven can plan.
