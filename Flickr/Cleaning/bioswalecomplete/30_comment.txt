Hi, I'm an admin for a group called DESIGN OF CITIES, and we'd love to have this added to the group!
Wow, ugly skateblocks. Otherwise a great space.
I feel like I was here but....where is this (street)?
It was on 12th Ave just a block from the green street photos, just on the opposite side of the building as more of a courtyard space.
