I loved those pictures, I love your work
Can you believe no snow or ice?  This is beautiful!
I certainly concur with inspiredinDesMoines. Gotta love this collage.
Very nicely composed. You balanced all 4 photos nicely. That rock and reflection is a strong photo.
And another nice collage it is - great job :-)
Lovely bokeh, top left
Nice story and photos!
