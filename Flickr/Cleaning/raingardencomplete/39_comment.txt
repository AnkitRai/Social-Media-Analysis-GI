This colorful rain garden is part of a cluster of 21 rain gardens installed along 8th Ave NW in Puyallup, WA beginning 2009.  The initial installation inspired the 8th Ave NW Street of Green, which now includes a project to convert a traditional roadway into one with pervious asphalt, pavers and more rain gardens.
