"I wonder if they have problems with rats nesting in these. Ive been thinking of lobbying for them, locally, but dont want to invite rats. Strange, I know  but it occurred to me that rats would love nesting here, and now I cant shake the thought.","10"
"I don't think nesting should be an issue.  Rats are typically seeking obscure places and with these being located on the sidewalk with pedestrians, doubt it should be a major problem.  At least I haven't heard of any issues in cities implementing LID.","10"
"Excellent!","12"

"Hello. -- Im all over the map in my interests ! Youd never know I could appreciate your photostream here according to all my flickr favorites showing. My mother was a perfectionist gardner ! So, I grew up {in Seattle} noticing this in my parent's home, as a result have a drawer of thought in my mind for appreciating every last type of shot you have in the totality of your set{s} of photos. I havent visited many {garden art-gallerys} people have worked hard to set up and maintain. But I definitely notice beautiful landscaping - anytime I see them. When I grew up - the Kent Valley was scattered farms, swamp areas full of frogs, and there was quite a few various types of other wildlife. It was spacious and {peaceful}, and beautiful, its where we (my parents) used to take a Sunday drive. Needless to say - those desirable conditions and times are now gone with the wind for that valley - and for MANY other areas around Seattle, and the outskirts, (at least that's from MY point of view). Thanks for the big pleasure of your photo stream here ! You sure covered {a lot} of beautiful areas and subjects. And BEAUTIFUL photographing ! ! ! ~ Very Sincerely","29"
"Interesting ! ... Actually - EVERY scene in this photostream is a REAL pleasure to see - and gain the awareness of these subjects  !","30"
"Looking great!","31"
"Love it!!","32"
"What color flowers do Happy and Sad dogwoods make?","33"
"The sad one won't produce ANY flowers if I can't get it shored up and properly rooted! :-) White otherwise.","33"
"I loved those pictures, I love your work","34"
"Can you believe no snow or ice?  This is beautiful!","34"
"I certainly concur with inspiredinDesMoines. Gotta love this collage.","34"
"Very nicely composed. You balanced all 4 photos nicely. That rock and reflection is a strong photo.","34"
"And another nice collage it is - great job :-)","34"
"Lovely bokeh, top left","34"
"Nice story and photos!","34"
"So pretty...worth the effort! (from my perspective, haha)","35"
"My thanks go to everyone on the site Wednesday and Thursday for a job well done. Special thanks to my fellow Master Gardeners, spouses and Yates County Cooperative Extension for their support (and sweat) put into this project. Meredith has provided a wonderful photo log of the project- she even knew the names of the plants! Impressive! Now we'll watch the garden grow and beautify the neighborhood.  Kathleen Badger","36"
"Hi, I'm an admin for a group called Rain Gardens, Rain Barrels  More, and we'd love to have this added to the group!","37"
"Very cool!  How did you do that???","38"
"With Photoshop and ImageReady. You make a photoshop file with 1 layer for each image. In ImageReady you spread that out across as many  frames as you want for the animation and adjust the percentage that each is seen.  I'm sure there are freeware / shareware tools out there to do it as well.","38"
"This colorful rain garden is part of a cluster of 21 rain gardens installed along 8th Ave NW in Puyallup, WA beginning 2009.  The initial installation inspired the 8th Ave NW Street of Green, which now includes a project to convert a traditional roadway into one with pervious asphalt, pavers and more rain gardens.  See this link raindogdesigns.com/wordpress/?page_id=1877.  This Old House Magazine also joined the fun to document six of these rain gardens in their September 2011 edition.  See this link raindogdesigns.com/wordpress/?page_id=147.","39"
"Good job!  I like your plant design and layout.","40"
"Thanks I am finally making some real progress. I made a set of the images from the last two years and love watching it slideshow style to see all the attempts and changes.","40"

"I really like this one.  Very imaginative.","43"
"I like this one too. Been watching the boats get installed and landscaping get started since mid summer. Turned out nice.","43"
"Like it.  Boats in the beds!","43"
"Green slime!","44"
"Very much looking forward to seeing how these develop. I am skeptical about:  1) short term maintenance - trash, dogshit, etc. 2) long term maintenance - replacing the sand once it becomes clogged every few years 3) re-educating DPW staff and the general public about these things. 4) standing water and mosquitos 5) the unknown unknowns - what happens when you infiltrate a bunch of water in medium sized point sources all over the city? sinkholes? flooded basements? green slime that reacts to human emotion? nothing? (alright, I'm actually excited by the chaotic implications, sometimes)","45"
"All valid points, of course. I don't know enough to answer them one way or another. But...  1) Dog shit is biodegradable, and will be mixed in with far more, less-toxic material, so that doesn't strike me as a huge deal, but I could be wrong. And I think the hope is that these will become little community spaces, and that someone will take ownership of them in some way, even if it's just picking out the obvious trash. Maybe that's wishful thinking, but even the most fanciful vision of street-level bioswales would include two per block, at most. It seems to me that SOMEONE would be motivated enough to at least pick up trash periodically from such small spaces. Just my opinion. You'll notice, however, that one of the bioswales has its input point blocked by...something (I didn't investigate).  2) Honest question: Does this even need to be done? If everything that washes into these bioswales is particulate matter, won't it just become part of the bioswale? Again, I'm just learning about this, so I could be completely off-base.  3) Absolutely agreed.   4) How long does water have to be standing before it attracts mosquitoes? Seems to me like the water would infiltrate long before that would be a concern.  5) These are the big questions, and obviously I have no idea. The city was engineered to carry water away from roads and homes as quickly as possible for a reason. That's not to say we can't/shouldn't find ways of naturalizing the process, just that we shouldn't forget why we built billions of dollars worth of sewer infrastructure in the first place.  Also, I'm worried about what this means long-term for development. I'm a Smart Growth guy, so I want Baltimore to be as densely as possible (while obviously allowing for well-planned green space). But once a huge vacant lot like the one at Baltimore  Mount is turned into a rain garden, does that take it off the development table forever?   What if the neighborhood rebounds to the point that someone wants to build something there - I'd say that'd be a good thing, but I think a lot of people would see that as giving our green space to developers. Even if we required that new development meet the level of SWM it currently achieves with the bioswale - will that be enough for people to be okay with it? Same goes for community gardens.   I'm not saying that every currently vacant site needs to be developed, even if that were economically feasible; but the conflict is bound to arise at some point, and I think it's a conversation worth having now.","45"

"The weekend was busy with driving to sporting events! (Ontario for rowing on Saturday; northern Detroit suburbs for lacrosse on Sunday)  Filling the pit has to wait until the coming week.","48"
"After the first two hours of work, I can attest that filling the hole is much easier than digging it! (20 degree lower temps are also welcome :-)","48"
"At least the sandy soil makes for easy digging....except for tree roots!","49"
"The very top layer of soil was kind of junky (probably due to disturbance for foundation repair), but otherwise good - glad we didn't encounter clay. The roots definitely were the hassle (including all the smaller ones, and the ones from the shrubs).","49"

"Good question. The building doesn't have gutters like you would see on a house, but I'm not sure if there is some type of drainage system on the roof of the building. Here is what the building looks like:    The rain gardens will be important because the area to the left is going to be a pedestrian promenade, so it will mostly be impervious surface","51"
