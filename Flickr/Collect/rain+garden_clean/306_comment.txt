The rain has given the whole photo a lovely texture. Hopefully next summer will be less damp - forever the optimist!Nice story and image well done.really cool and wonderful photo...good workNicely done !!Fascinating, this is the second photo of yours where you've managed to use the rain as a texture that otherwise could only be replicated in software(if at all). I echo the impressionist observation with a modification. You are painting with your eyes using your lens as your brush...I agree, the texture is amazing. Great work
