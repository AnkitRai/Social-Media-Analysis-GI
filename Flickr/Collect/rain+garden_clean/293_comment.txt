And what a find - hope you took some blackberries home to make that pie!Nice, looks like Mother Nature is taking back that plot, like the darkness of  door and windows surrounded by nature, now please pass some pie.Really cool.  Sometimes I wonder about abandoned places and think about their history.  In this case, was it part of a thriving farm - did it have a lot of usage or was it just something put up for hunters to stay dry in inclement weather.

This is great - love the moss on the roof.Fantastic Kurt, it reminds me of something that would be in the Shire.  With a hobbit living in it.What a cool shot - really great compositionAt first I thought &quot;BB&quot; - Bed &amp; Breakfast - then wondered what kind of person other than a nature lover would stay here.  I might with all those berries to be picked.  Heavenly place.There might have been shortage on other things but one could certainly survive on blackberry pie for.... some time!LOL!  BB pie?  Who are you kidding!  Stocked with cases of pinot noir and cigars, if you ask me!  =)   Talk about Mother Nature reclaiming!  If only those walls could talk!  Love the pov depth that that top right corner provides!I was picking some berries in a State park one day, long, long ago, with some friends.  It turned out the Rangers didn't like that one bit and fined us for &quot;molesting the vegetation&quot;.  We had to pick up trash the whole weekend.  So whenever I see a big ol' patch of berries like this, I get a little nervous.  Kinda like that feeling you get when you've got a cop following you down the road.  You know you aren't doing anything wrong, but you spend a lot of time staring at your speedometer. :-)

SWEEEEET SHOT.BEAUTIFUL!!! I'd def expect to see Hobbits or something from a fantasy living there.  Such a cool find![http://www.flickr.com/photos/sonoraguy]
