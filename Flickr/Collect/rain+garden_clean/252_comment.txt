Absolutely beautiful!  I do hope the predicted burst of cold weather does not do too much damage to your spring garden.Your Gardens are so beautiful !  Sad when snow hits us in the Spring.  I had one lovely day with my magnolia tree in bloom.  Same thing happened here.your garden is looking fabulous T&amp;M
hope it survives the change in weather
we just had the warmest March ever - blooms are easily 2-4 weeks ahead of the normperfect story.

Thank you for the horticultural well wishes - of course, we hope (know, actually) that you'll have a blooming 2012 in your stunning garden too. We're STILL hoping to travel up to your neck of the woods at some point... Aching to see your garden in glorious 3D (... or is it 4D, if you include scent?!)
Take care
Cassie &amp; TerryI don't know how, but  ckicking for inviting this photo, I deleted from the group where it just was.
Sorry for that!Beautiful image!  ~Sam
