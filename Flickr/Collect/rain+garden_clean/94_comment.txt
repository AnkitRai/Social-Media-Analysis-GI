I love zinnias!  My favorite is the smaller cut and come again.Zinnias gaudy-never!  They're my favorite. :)Pretty!i seeded So many state fair zinnias... none of them have flowered. some are still putting up leafy stalks, but no flowers. =( i don't know why so many of my flowers and herbs failed this year. slugs maybe? there are a lot of slugs here. i don't know. at least i can look at Your zinnias =)i LOVE zinnias. they are really exquisite blooms, and such beautiful vibrant colors. my favorite garden flowers along with sunflowers.....
