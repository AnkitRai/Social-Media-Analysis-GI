One day I will have our garden looking like my gardens I had in Australia.  Darling Shane isn't a gardener so there is a lot of work to be done!

This is a little slice of Heaven Steve.What an incredibly beautiful garden, Steve.  Lovely flowers and you even have a few of my favorites.  I used to grow hyacinths on my balcony in Maryland but I don't think I have ever seen a <i>water</i> hyacinth.This is so good to see SteveExcellent capture!!!!Love all the plants surrounding that pretty pond...especially the Japanese maple! we are probably 1 hardiness zone cooler that you are here, so they are only marginally hardy and have to be protected.
