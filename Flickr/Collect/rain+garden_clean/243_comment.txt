That's super cool, the framing and crop is just right. Tim Burton like!Super!!! it is so beautiful!!!Wonderful! Would even like it more without the tourists, but they add some colour contrasts though:)[http://www.flickr.com/photos/61107395@N00] I do have a couple of shots without the tourists and as attractive as they are I think the inclusion of the tourists just makes for a better visual story, imo...then again...!I've always been terrified of these mazes for some reason... I think I've watched one too many scary movie (&quot;The Shining&quot; immediately comes to mind) and I'm afraid of getting lost and never finding my way out.  So now I need a psychiatrist to tell me exactly what that means... LOL!
Fabulous image Tony - I love the intense green, the patterns, the textures and the amazing PoV.  Brilliant work!!

Thank you for your visit and wonderful comments today... it was a treat to read them!! 
Have a fabulous weekend my friend! xx :-)[http://www.flickr.com/photos/rufusdufus] - I like that you included the people... they remind me of little mice in a test lab.  They give us a great sense of scale too.excellent details of the greenery,
very lovely shot Tony!

ps: thanks Tony, yes I do realise by now to just 'drop' everything and come back again,
it works most of the time! :)Looks like you managed to get a cracking shot here, when I was there, there were so many people you could hardly see the maze.Amazing shot Tony!

TonyAs you say, it makes a much better story with the people in. I particularly like the fact that they're heading away from the hut (which the viewer presumes is the centre)! 
Really nice shot Tony. (And a nice maze too!)haha, thats cool. i love your patience. yes i would wait hours if i knew that perfect shot was coming up. hell, i wold wait literally days for that!!!!!!! 
ok anyway, techincally speaking(for me) this shot is great. the seperation of the normal colors and the green automatically makes it a nice composition. so for that you win! great shot Tony! its nice to see a non bacl and white from you. i dont hate black and white, but i believe there is few oppurtunities to make it work properly. ok, i hope you understand! :)very nicely composed. . .patience sure pays off :)
what a nice maze, interesting!nice shot, very vibrant greenawesome composition 
i get an almost surreal sense of nature hereExcellent! The wait paid off!je je, que buena!A labyrinth!!Fabulous!!  It IS rather Tim Burtonesque!!!  I'm actually quite good in mazes/labyrinth's - maybe because I don't panic (well, I haven't yet and they've been fairly straightforward - this one looks more complicated!).  Love the vibrant green!I love labirints!!! You are a very good photographer!!! Can you give me some Advice? Thanks a lotYour 20 minutes paid well, Tony! The image looks beautifully with the &quot;fingerprint&quot; leaveing an amazing graphical textured pattern.Muy buena.
