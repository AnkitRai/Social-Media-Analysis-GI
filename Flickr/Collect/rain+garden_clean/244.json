It was a favorite place of Tigger's. He used to lay on and under a bench just to the right, which he used to keep cool in the summer.\n\n I wonder what he'd think of the place now that so much has changed? They've covered the ruins, and I imagine, had he lived there after they did that, he would have loved it, He would have had some shelter there. As it was, there was only a little, open gazebo roof for Tig to use when it rained.\n\n For years he had no bed, no blanket, no creature comforts other than a bowl of food which was often eaten by raccoons, or some water they dirtied up dunking the food into! All that changed after January 2008, when I saw this phenomenal animal needed some TLC, and with help from the folks on Flickr, I got him the care he needed. When a horrible storm threatened, I got him out of there, and kept him as part of my family from then on. I will miss him dreadfully now that he's gone...."},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1356727193","taken":"2008-08-01 20:53:07","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1429124028"},"views":"3521","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":0,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":0},"comments":{"_content":"8"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"7262148-8318530315-28638980","author":"7294287@N04","authorname":"Chris C.
