.Great lighting and shadows!  A beautiful yard!well, all those described maybe over, given in to insects or be on strike - but your garden looks fabulous.  Interested to hear you have impatiens, in this country we have had a disease and it looks as if it has been wiped out and now a few nursery people will be nurturing  it back for the population in general - so I doubt it will be a good buy for several years to come . . .Belle photo de ce jardin si bien entretenu.
Bonne journe Patricia.awesome capture!Walking round your garden is something I would love to do one day!<b> The Garden Gnome Approves :</b>

I love the colours dotted about and connecting the plants.I wish I could get my garden to look like yours, it's so beautiful Patricia!still a garden of eden to my eyesIt seems to be that wonderful stage in the season when color comes in waves. I dream about those warm evenings and the sounds and light from the garden. This photo makes me feel very nostalgic, knowing we have several months to wait for those gifts. It snowed this morning!
