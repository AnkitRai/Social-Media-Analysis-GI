We were delighted to receive a total of 111 visitors and, together with donations, raised \u00a3436 for the charity &quot;Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research UK''. \n\nWe were very pleased that the  Walsall Mayor Councillor Dennis Anson and Mayoress Kate Anson were able to visit the garden towards the end of the afternoon and they seemed to really enjoy themselves, despite the rain!  \n\nSince 2006 we have welcomed more than 9,000 visitors to our garden open days and we are sincerely grateful to them all for raising over \u00a328,400 for our named charities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1348835991","taken":"2012-09-28 12:59:12","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1411674048"},"views":"3552","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":1,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":1},"comments":{"_content":"14"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"23816668-8032562377-90356","author":"23909481@N08","authorname":"Four Seasons Garden","raw":"tapestry","_content":"tapestry","machine_tag":0},{"id":"23816668-8032562377-1483","author":"23909481@N08","authorname":"Four Seasons Garden","raw":"garden","_content":"garden","machine_tag":0},{"id":"23816668-8032562377-545","author":"23909481@N08","authorname":"Four Seasons Garden","raw":"colour","_content":"colour","machine_tag":0},{"id":"23816668-8032562377-11551","author":"23909481@N08","authorname":"Four Seasons Garden","raw":"foliage","_content":"foliage","machine_tag":0},{"id":"23816668-8032562377-140","author":"23909481@N08","authorname":"Four Seasons Garden","raw":"flowers","_content":"flowers","machine_tag":0}]},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage","_content":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/fourseasonsgarden\/8032562377\/"}]},"media":"photo"},"stat":"ok"}
