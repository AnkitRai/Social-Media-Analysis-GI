What a lovely garden, Judy. You must love spending time in it and tending to the plants and flowers. Everything is so lush and green. The colours of the spring flowers are splendidly vibrant and cheery. Simply beautiful :)))
so lush! beautiful!
You have such a beautiful garden with so many bright colors. My sister has started working on a garden and it has inspired me. The more gardens I see like this the more I want to start on of my own. <a href="http://www.budgetblinds.com/Coachella_Valley_Palm_Springs/" rel="nofollow">www.budgetblinds.com/Coachella_Valley_Palm_Springs/</a>
