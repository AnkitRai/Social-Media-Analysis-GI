Just a small accumulation of droplets you have there! The season has been crazy, I can't believe the amount of rain we have had. I'm sure you will take the damage in your stride. As for the floods, not good to be in that situation, no fun whatsoever
wow how much rain you have so much wow we need some here but nothing yet and it is summer time so for sure no rain but so hot
Hai catturato veramente una bellissima immagine, i miei complimenti !!!!!!!!!! Un caro saluto.
Hi KT Looks like my back yard yesterday there was a river running down it ,luckily for me the drains coped this time .I live in a place called Todmorden and lots of houses and shops were flooded all the roads in and out were blocked for about half a day it is sooooo hard on the people who get flooded ,the mess is devastating and takes months to put right as i found out about 5 years ago when we got the water in our house.
A nice capture Katie, looks like  paddle to get to your greenhouse, nice refection.
Hi Katie. You have had a lot of rain! Your shot well shown it. Sorry for damage in your wanderful garden.....hope you have a lovely weather as soon. Have a nice weekend.
Same here, when will it end? This is suposed to be summer :o)
And my water butts are empty, Katie! Rather them stay that way, than have the deluge, which you have experienced! A great shot, by the way!
Ou, the green thing wasn't a surfboard....
