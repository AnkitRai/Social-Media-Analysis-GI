Home is where you find understanding.\nNicht da ist man daheim, wo man seinen Wohnsitz hat, sondern wo man verstanden wird. (Christian Morgenstern)\n\nMY home is where my Hero Husband is, always was, and will be..... Since he happens to be here, so is my home! (Kiki)<\/b>\n\nSitting there, in the midst of the greens - in the sunlight or under the rain.... my veranda, my quiet heaven, my harbour, my recluse...\nIt features a little round table for two and two very comfy rattan 'fauteuils' (deep armchair with plenty of space, painted a clean white... a delight), a white sunshade to protect our heads and\/or the plants of too much sun. It has lamps and candles, always flowers and hanging banana leaves, drooping down in a great tiredness or standing proud in their youthful growth. When the leaves cannot unfold as they want, they turn brown but stay... just quietly showing their discomfort.... Snails are feasting on the fat, waterlogged meandering leaves of a plant I still always forget the name but who has pinkish flowers for about 2-4 weeks. I am mostly feasting on wonderful breakfasts, light lunches and lots of mugs of tea and glasses of wine, depending on the season. A book (at least one) and sudoku are never too far either. Now in the days of heat  waves, I'm neither in the veranda nor the garden, but inside where it's cooler. The geranium thrive in this heat, hydrangeas feel so-so.... the roses have no leaves left but grow flowers in a silly way.... the asters are nearly ready with their tiny pink, rose, white star-flowers.... the world is a good and lovely place!\n\n<b>Have a happy Scarlet Sunday!<\/b>\n\n<b>\u00a9 All rights reserved<\/b> \nKindly visit my <a href=\"http:\/\/bighugelabs.com\/flickr\/dna.php?username=vol-au-vent\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b> Flickr DNA<\/b><\/a> for more information on me and my work. \n\n\u266b <b> | <\/b>   <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/vol-au-vent\/sets\/72157607848733477\/\">SQUARE<\/a> <b> | <\/b>  \u266b  <b> | <\/b>   <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/vol-au-vent\/sets\/72157594339553045\/\">-25 FAVES<\/a><b> | <\/b> \u266b  <b> | <\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/vol-au-vent\/sets\/72157605128679187\/\">FRENCH IMPRESSIONS<\/a> <b> | <\/b>   \u266b"},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1251582644","taken":"2009-08-12 16:05:07","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1416953282"},"views":"10681","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":0,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":0},"comments":{"_content":"39"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"2540538-3868917186-32133315","author":"98839685@N00","authorname":"Vol-au-Vent","raw":"Kiki Vol-au-Vent","_content":"kikivolauvent","machine_tag":0},{"id":"2540538-3868917186-487","author":"98839685@N00","authorname":"Vol-au-Vent","raw":"France","_content":"france","machine_tag":0},{"id":"2540538-3868917186-709","author":"98839685@N00","authorname":"Vol-au-Vent","raw":"home","_content":"home","machine_tag":0},{"id":"2540538-3868917186-1483","author":"98839685@N00","authorname":"Vol-au-Vent","raw":"garden","_content":"garden","machine_tag":0},{"id":"2540538-3868917186-46642","author":"98839685@N00","authorname":"Vol-au-Vent","raw":"glasshouse","_content":"glasshouse","machine_tag":0},{"id":"2540538-3868917186-12155","author":"98839685@N00","authorname":"Vol-au-Vent","raw":"veranda","_content":"veranda","machine_tag":0},{"id":"2540538-3868917186-9574","author":"98839685@N00","authorname":"Vol-au-Vent","raw":"conservatory","_content":"conservatory","machine_tag":0},{"id":"2540538-3868917186-44716530","author":"98839685@N00","authorname":"Vol-au-Vent","raw":"even greenhouse.... nah, MOST definitely greenhouse....","_content":"evengreenhousenahmostdefinitelygreenhouse","machine_tag":0},{"id":"2540538-3868917186-44716532","author":"98839685@N00","authorname":"Vol-au-Vent","raw":"although not in its proper sense but in the sense of being GREEN and stuffed full with banana 'trees', camellia, birds' seeds going wild, an agapanthum, hanging baskets, cut flowers, rubbish....","_content":"althoughnotinitspropersensebutinthesenseofbeinggreenandstuffedfullwithbananatreescamelliabirdsseedsgoingwildanagapanthumhangingbasketscutflowersrubbish","machine_tag":0},{"id":"2540538-3868917186-44716534","author":"98839685@N00","authorname":"Vol-au-Vent","raw":"focal softness with dreamy blurr of the rest -
