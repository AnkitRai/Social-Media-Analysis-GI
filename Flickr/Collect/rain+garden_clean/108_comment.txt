Sums it up perfectly LIsa
Weather is rubbish but great shot of the garden
Great scene, nice story but I hoped you'll be able fix your pump !
You've got a lovely garden even in the pouring rain, I wish that stupid jetstream would bugger off to where it should be ! I think chickens have knees don't they, isn't the bit that looks like a knee actually an ankle and the knee is further up, I'm rambling now.........an expert on chickens I'm not !
buy some Ducks? (at least they would be happy)!!!
Fine shot, it certainly has been a rubbish summer so far!  [http://www.flickr.com/photos/58133324@N06] You could have a point there.
I'm Getting Webbed Feet! Nice shot Lisa!
Did you have to Lisa!! Great shot, I bet it looks so much better in the sunshine.
Such a lovely garden!
oh you have a beautiful garden!!!!
They sure do have knees, and am sure they hate water up to their knees as much as us humans! Hasn't it been a pain this week! Can't bring myself to venture down the the plot, would just have to cry I think!
That's a lovely looking garden you have there. Would like to see another shot of it when the sun is out! (Next year ;-) )
