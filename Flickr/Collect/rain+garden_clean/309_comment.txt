<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1216504@N22/"><b> NATURE'S CAROUSEL POST 1 AWARD 2</b></a>Well, it is looking nice now. The canna leaf popping out is cute.That looks like a happy garden! Here's to hoping for a rainy winter and a normal summer next year!I would hear the weather forecast for Texas and think of you but you manage to have this gorgeous garden despite such harsh conditions!  From this photo, you would never think that was Texas.  I'm glad the weather is changing for you.Patricia I am just amazed at your wonderful garden, I have just shown my husband, as I  find it so hard to believe it is an Austin garden, It could easily be an English garden!  My congratulations to you!I think you do a great job.  I know how difficult it is to garden in excessive heat.  I used to live in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, and starting mid-July the temps went into the 90's followed by August and September in the 100's...oppressive...and like you, very little or no rain.   I love how you share your garden with us, and I so enjoy the photographs.well, I think your garden is a miracle, Patricia - I can't begin to imagine what  it must be like to garden in those conditions . . . you are right, it isn't easyWhat an amazing and lovely shot of your garden! It is absolutely thriving despite the wretched heat and you've babied it along beautifully! Hope the temps come down soon, has to be awful for you and the plants!Yes very nice Patricia, is that chrysanthemum a new addition or has it been there for years?

Insane temperatures, I would never leave the house!!

Greetings from the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles!!It is incredible how the tender foliage does not have any signs of burning from the intense heat you experienced this winter. No doubt, there will be a second blaze of glory soon!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/592858@N21/"><b> The Garden Gnome Award Group</b></a>just look at all the blooms!!!Super garden. Looks impressive!!Looks so luscious and fresh.  You would never guess that your beautiful garden is subject to such high temps.    Here's me moaning about our rain.  I guess we could do a swap although I dont think I could grow anything as beautiful as you do.    I am not sure if I could cope with such high temps so there would be very little hope for the plants!Beautiful garden , love the mix of colours!!!Great variety of plants and doing well if you ask me!  They've obviously been very well taken care of despite your very hot summer..
