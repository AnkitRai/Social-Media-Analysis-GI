Nice rainy day.  I once shot that trumpet flower.  [http://www.flickr.com/photos/30255355@N00/3810940057/in/set-72157622843291377]It's good I'm not closer... we had a recent deep frost and they are browned and fading fast.  I love the look of them though also!

Thanks![http://www.flickr.com/photos/teamgriggs]  I also believe these flowers are poisonous.  Anyhow, thanks for the great effort in the rain.   These rainy day images are quite special.Again I thank you.  I really enjoy rainy day photography (if it's not too cold or too rainy, lol...)Thanks for the going out in the rain and great image!  Well composed!! The rain does something really magical sometimes and you captured it here.Much appreciated, thank you!
