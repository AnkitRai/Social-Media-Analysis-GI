 [http://www.flickr.com/photos/dmorbeto] Hi Miss I - my macro's are taken with an attachment that fits on to the phone, great fun!
 [http://www.flickr.com/photos/unruly-e] I know! These things are like buses it seems ...
 [http://www.flickr.com/photos/catcalledmorris] I wish I knew! I have no idea why I wrote it off that day, maybe the blade of grass that went through the middle of the image, made me unhappy that it wasn't perfect enough, but now I quite like that bit and the lazy raindrop sitting on it! ;-)

Big thanks for all the faves and group invites on this one too, blown away by the response! Cheers all[http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindsey76/] Oh no a new toy to buy!!!!!!!  I'm obsessed!!!!!!  I'm gonna be iBroke soon.

<i>Seen in my recent comments.</i> <em>(<a href="http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html" rel="nofollow">?</a>)</em>Thanks for the fave SUF!Amazing![http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979691@N05] Thanks so much again:-)

@ion ~ thanks for the fave :-)LOVE IT ... I'm sure you have been asked 1000x - what macro lens do you use?I'm thinking to get that little macro but waiting to see what the iPhone 5 is going to offer. 

I counted 67 water drops and gave up ... ;)@Audrey ~ thanks so much for adding this to your wonderful gallery!! 
 [http://www.flickr.com/photos/35921617@N05] Thank you for the lovely comment and drop counting ;)  The macro I use is 'Skina', been really pleased with the results and wasn't too expensive either, it would definitely fit the 4S.

@Phil ~ thanks for the favourite :)Liz - thanks again lovely lady :-)@franciavega @Kelly ~ many thanks for the faves both :))
