The sky was heavily overcast with the occasional shower of the infamous Cornish mizzle soaking us throughout the day. Glendurgan Gardens is a place I'd love to go back to sometime as it has an amazing collection of tree ferns and other exotica from around the world due to the very mild and sunny climate found in Cornwall. One of its highlights is the maze which, when seen from above, resembles a green human fingerprint, a brilliant design as it blends into the landscape so sympathetically...it took me 20 minutes of waiting either for the rain to stop or people to get into the right position for the comp before I could get a decent shot of it."},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1314831587","taken":"2011-08-24 16:44:18","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1423667253"},"views":"1513","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":0,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":1},"comments":{"_content":"26"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"43548713-6101049737-437404","author":"43580852@N04","authorname":"Fly bye!","raw":"Glendurgan","_content":"glendurgan","machine_tag":0},{"id":"43548713-6101049737-3956987","author":"43580852@N04","authorname":"Fly bye!","raw":"Glendurgan Gardens","_content":"glendurgangardens","machine_tag":0},{"id":"43548713-6101049737-3360","author":"43580852@N04","authorname":"Fly bye!","raw":"Cornwall","_content":"cornwall","machine_tag":0},{"id":"43548713-6101049737-1483","author":"43580852@N04","authorname":"Fly bye!","raw":"garden","_content":"garden","machine_tag":0},{"id":"43548713-6101049737-37614","author":"43580852@N04","authorname":"Fly bye!","raw":"National Trust","_content":"nationaltrust","machine_tag":0},{"id":"43548713-6101049737-14688","author":"43580852@N04","authorname":"Fly bye!","raw":"hedge","_content":"hedge","machine_tag":0},{"id":"43548713-6101049737-18347","author":"43580852@N04","authorname":"Fly bye!","raw":"maze","_content":"maze","machine_tag":0},{"id":"43548713-6101049737-417","author":"43580852@N04","authorname":"Fly bye!","raw":"plant","_content":"plant","machine_tag":0},{"id":"43548713-6101049737-12640","author":"43580852@N04","authorname":"Fly bye!","raw":"hut","_content":"hut","machine_tag":0},{"id":"43548713-6101049737-20169","author":"43580852@N04","authorname":"Fly bye!","raw":"thatch","_content":"thatch","machine_tag":0},{"id":"43548713-6101049737-9952","author":"43580852@N04","authorname":"Fly bye!","raw":"tourists","_content":"tourists","machine_tag":0}]},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage","_content":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/rufusdufus\/6101049737\/"}]},"media":"photo"},"stat":"ok"}
