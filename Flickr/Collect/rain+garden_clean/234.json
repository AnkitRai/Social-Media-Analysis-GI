Fortunately they did not last long and provided some beautiful skies, but we also had to duck in to various shops, pavilions, and restaurants for cover.\n\nIn this instance, we could see the rain clouds building and there was already light drizzle. Since it was near dinner time, Carrie went to scope out an inside table at Casey's. I made a mad dash to the castle because the light was really good.\n\nAfter remembering one of my many lessons learned of photography, I turned around and away from the setting sun and saw this scene. This vantage was way more interesting than the sunset that evening. So, the lesson here is don't forget to look all around you, the real shot may be in the opposite direction than you think!\n\nCarrie was able to get an inside table just as I returned to Casey's, and it gave us a great place to wait out the heavy rain that ensued for the next hour.\n\n<i>Walt Disney World | Magic Kingdom | Plaza Rose Garden<\/i>"},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1337858778","taken":"2012-05-06 18:06:40","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1389885906"},"views":"2993","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":1,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":1},"comments":{"_content":"9"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"51419678-7261157264-34928","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"Walt","_content":"walt","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-9798","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"Disney","_content":"disney","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-5","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"World","_content":"world","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-29518","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"WDW","_content":"wdw","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-5999","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"Magic","_content":"magic","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-8442","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"Kingdom","_content":"kingdom","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-91","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"Plaza","_content":"plaza","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-986","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"Rose","_content":"rose","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-1483","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"Garden","_content":"garden","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-2752","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"Swan","_content":"swan","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-1783","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"Boats","_content":"boats","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-37067","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"Tomorrowland","_content":"tomorrowland","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-223","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"Sunset","_content":"sunset","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-1382","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"Canon","_content":"canon","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-1966","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"EOS","_content":"eos","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-16104","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"7D","_content":"7d","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-883341","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"17-55mm","_content":"1755mm","machine_tag":0},{"id":"51419678-7261157264-56210","author":"51442732@N03","authorname":"Brett Kiger","raw":"HDR","_content":"hdr","machine_tag":0}]},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage","_content":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/brettkiger\/7261157264\/"}]},"media":"photo"},"stat":"ok"}
