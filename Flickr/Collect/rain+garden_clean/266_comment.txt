Everything looks so healthy, and so colouful.
Awesome beauty! I am in love with your garden!
Lovely capture.
Beautiful image with splendid colors!.
So lush and very gorgeous!!  The colours are so rich and wonderful.
Gorgeous, Imac and the new Flickr do a better justice to your amazing garden, this is beyond anything I have personally seen in any of my travels!
I can't imagine the level of maintenance to keep it looking like that. Full time job, but beautiful!
Unimaginably gorgeous!!  The colors are magnificent.  What a satisfying feeling it must be to see your gorgeous garden at this time of year.  I, too, have found that rain seems to intensify the colors of the garden but the colors you have are already so lovely that the little boost from the rain pushes the plants off the scale of beauty!
Wonderful!!!
