denisMagnificent image from the Arboretum.  October is the best month to photograph the Japanese Gardens, and you did it beautifully.Spectacular scene, beautifully captured! Love it!Although rain is an obstacle it makes the colors pop out even more. Wonderful angle of the path, capture of color and details.Excellent colors.  Love the color of the Japanese Maples all the time, but especially in the fall.Lovely colour and composition; I really like the stone bridge / path disappearing into the picture.Color looks awesome! Love this composition!Lovely capture
