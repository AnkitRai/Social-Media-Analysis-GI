A very nice garden, I could spend some time here.
Bet it's even better with the colourful flowers
Lovely terraced garden Gary. I would imagine its photogenic all year round.
[https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterconway] Thanks Pete. It's a bit of a labour of love, I guess like most gardeners I spend a lot of time working on it, but nowhere near enough time enjoying it. Hard work, but worth it as I derive so much pleasure from the garden.
You sound like my dad :-)

There's no place like your garden to relax and listen to nature all around you but like you say it can be hard work at times

Old Chinese Proverb. If you want to be happy for a year get a hobby. If you want to be happy for many years get a wife. If you want to be happy for the rest of your life get a garden.

Got one out the three gents lol

Haha
Beautiful garden bones!  The rain accentuates the colors and form.
