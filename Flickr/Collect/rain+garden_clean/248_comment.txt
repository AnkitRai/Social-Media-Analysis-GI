Great details in this. Nice.[http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewkumler/] <b>Andrew Kumler</b> - This is like a fake PNW shot, eh?!  Joe was commenting about how much like the PNW this place was... and I was definitely amazed how wet it was.Really a nice one, Ivan!!

There are good and bad things about the rain when you are a photographer, huh? And you have be out in it to experience both.great contrast betwenn the green moos ( very luminous ) and this flow

No better time to waterfall then in the rain.This is great, love the greens![http://www.flickr.com/photos/sicalufakiss/] <b>~ Aaron Reed ~</b> - Haha!

Very nice work... as always.Lovely composition &amp; beautiful image !
Well taken !This looks awesome Ivan!!  Love the intimate feel and lushness of the canyon here.  Great choice on the long exposure, and it's sweet that the greenery stayed still long enough for you!Those are really some deep delicious greens you got here!    Good for you for going out and grabbing some shots.    Beautiful image.     I like the off color water.   I headed out on Sunday and grabbed a few in the rain as well...shots forthcoming.This is one heck of a really cool creek shot. It looks so nice and vivid from all that wet stuff. Very cool, and sounds like a heck of a day.Beaut little waterfall. Love all that moss and the ferns! Well executed Ivan.green feels awesome in winter
thanks for sharingThis is fantastic! I love that hike - some of the prettiest series of falls in the Bay area.

(Came here via Joe's photo).great greens 

love the smooth water it contrasts against the folliage 



we do wonder why we head out at times   putting our faith in Mr WeathermanGreat shot! The effort was worth it.Hehe... same here - thought you hooked up with the Northwestern guys ;) Great find and even better timing to shoot it! Love the cascading water and the softness of the flow! Excellent and well worth getting wet, Ivan!This is fantastic Ivan! Great stuff!That water is soooo creamy. Looks like someone dumped a vat of rootbeer floats.Sweet details here Ivan!! So lush mate &amp; the waterflow just sets it off!!!
Very cool work mate!!Wonderful - great work on what sounds like a very wet session!  I love the detail in the greens and that section of falls that Didenze noted.  All the best to you over the holidays!I am glad you followed through! Beautiful!Awesome shot Ivan... I have been itching to shoot some flowing water but we are too dry here... hope you have a great holiday season!Looks really good Ivan.  Glad you could enjoy one of my favorite Bay Area water falls.  If you liked that hike, I'd recommend checking out Big Basin's Berry Creek Falls hike in the Santa Cruze Mountains.Really awesome clarity and colors.
Excellent composition and exposure.
Sublime greens.
Congrats, Ivan.great water and the saturated colours in the foliage work really well..Super shot Ivan, those greens are just exploding - I like the contrast with the browns too and of course your comp is great.  Plus my wife just walked by and said 'that one's nice'...believe me, that's high praise.very nice Ivan ,, great processing ...the color just popsLooks like it was really flowing!!!!
Amazing.love it!inspiring stuff ivan - the greens are super lush and the watermovement just the right stillnessMagical light and colors. That little mist and water exposure adds so much flavor to this brilliant shot.

Seen in my contacts' photos. (<a href="http://red.trailr.info/red2.php?tlrv=10200000&amp;tlrurl=http://www.trailr.info" rel="nofollow"> <b>?</b> </a>)Wow that water is fantastic, did a milk truck explode upstream?Love the rich greens, nice.This is really really nice Ivan!!!!!   I think you nailed the comp, and the amount of motion in the water is dead on.  It is always so amazing to me how much light moss/rice/other light green grasses reflect light on overcast and rainy days.  Sometimes it really pays to be out when the weather is bad.That is a beautiful spot you found, and some great greens. Very nice IvanBeautiful green colours, the water worked out well. Interesting reading your EXIF and notes.Thanks
A Merry Xmas to you Ivan
Cheers Peterthose greens are nice and juicy.  nice one, great detail, happy holidays to you and your family.Beautiful capture Ivan.
Merry Christmas.Merry Christmas, Ivan!I've been to Mt. Tam, but I didn't know this area existed.  Sweet shot, nice even exposure, and great depth.Too many contacts and I keep missing your amazing work, another classic stunner, hope your well Ivan, Happy New Year!Wooo!
awesome with the 15secs effect!!SO lush and beautiful! A real treat on the eyes.  

Hope the holidays are going well : )looks like the flippin Garden of Eden!Pin sharp image and the green looks gorgeous with a silky water. Just perfectly composed, Ivan. Thanks for all the support and friendship, Happy New Year :)Careful who you hang out with...I hear that &quot;Joe&quot; fella is trouble ;)

Joking aside, nicely done. I like the luminosity in the foliage.really lovely.brilliantly done. It looks like milk :)Fern flow, try glow...the entire image is glowing Ivan. The greens are incredibly luscious, the details and sharpness delicious. I think you getting that close to the torrent was well worth it, the additional length of the cascading flow you captured adds a lot of depth to the image and compositional interest. Love itWell.... It looks like a missed a good afternoon. Great color here. As you, and others have said.... I would have thought this to be in the PNW..... Happy New Year.LovelyBeautifulStunning shot! Appreciate the excellent detail!
