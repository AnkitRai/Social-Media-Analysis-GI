About five minutes before I arrived at Joe's house, the rain lightened... ahhh.  Joe had about three different satellite radars plugged into his phone and assured me we were in the midst of a short break in the storm.  Off we went to Cataract Falls.\n\nWe arrived at the trailhead to Cataract Falls, on Mt. Tamalpais, and suited up in waterproof garb.  After about three or so sock-fall-down-Ivan-pull-up sessions, we reached the top cascade of falls.  The rain was on and off, but really didn't matter.  We were wet, the falls were roaring, and it was amazing to be out in the thick of it.  It was a great day shooting with Joe.   \n\nThis shot was taken towards the top of the falls.  The fog was pretty thick, and the murky water was absolutely pounding its way through a narrow spot in the creek, so there wasn't any detail in the water.  I opted for a longer exposure to soften the water and help the details in the ferns come out.  I used a polarizer to knock down the white reflections of the leaves, and was as far as I could get without falling in the torrent.  Hope you like.  \n\n\nCanon 5D Mark II\nCanon 24-105L @67mm\n15 second exposure @ F16\nB+W circular polarizer filter\nSingle exposure at ISO 50"},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1292898633","taken":"2010-12-19 13:40:00","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1391007854"},"views":"12985","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":1,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":1},"comments":{"_content":"82"},"notes":{"note":[{"id":"72157625518522017","author":"53419402@N08","authorname":"Didenze","x":"81","y":"91","w":"91","h":"176","_content":"Great cascade!"},{"id":"72157625530201089","author":"40408627@N07","authorname":"Dan Ballard Photography","x":"267","y":"95","w":"191","h":"177","_content":"My favorite part;))  So f-ing cool!!!!"},{"id":"72157626452382288","author":"21491133@N02","authorname":"louie imaging","x":"3","y":"2","w":"31","h":"31","_content":"this is awsome ivan!!"}]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"9657779-5278648027-397726","author":"9678127@N02","authorname":"Ivan Sohrakoff","raw":"Cataract Falls","_content":"cataractfalls","machine_tag":0},{"id":"9657779-5278648027-280865","author":"9678127@N02","authorname":"Ivan Sohrakoff","raw":"Mt.
