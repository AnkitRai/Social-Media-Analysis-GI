[https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterconway] Thanks Pete, I know what you mean! The estate stands on land that was once part of the grounds of a large hall, so probably quite apt.

What a nice variety.

It looks so green and lush!  I like the different forms and textures and shades of green.  Nice work, Gary!
