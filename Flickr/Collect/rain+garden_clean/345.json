The six stanzas beautifully complement each other and have so much power; it seems that most Aussies make do with the second stanza. Well I remember reciting this and 'A bush Christening' along with 'The Man from Snowy River' for my Uncle's recently acquired 'Reel to Reel'; it took forever to learn the words even longer to get a delivery that he was happy with but eventually he coughed-up the promised 5\/-. He was a generous old 'bugger' but wanted his pound of flesh!\n\nFive 'bob' was a lot of dough back in '53."},{"id":"31855227-18227979756-72157651390557364","author":"77215799@N00","authorname":"aa_just_thowt","iconserver":"8637","iconfarm":9,"datecreate":"1433019503","permalink":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/31860567@N05\/18227979756\/#comment72157651390557364","path_alias":null,"realname":"Peter","_content":"'53?
