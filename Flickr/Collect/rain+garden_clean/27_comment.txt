No wonder you love it, it's like a little piece of heaven.
oooh you got rain? nice i love the slight underexposure here to really bring out the mood and dampness that was there. plus, i'm starting to be interested in the art of creative underexposure

looks like you pack an awful lot into that little space. I think your garden looks enchanting &amp; so gorgeous wet.
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/22487105@N06] its actually quite crazy, i've got 30 chilies, 18 tomatoes, numerous herbs, some geraniums &amp; wave petunias, gerber daisies on top other plants. i can't stop planting. it's an addiction! soon i'll be thinking of any fall crops i might want to put in. but i love it! and you're right, in the rain its beautiful!
it looks heavenly!  i'm addicted too.  the only way i won't plant anything else is to stay out of the nursery.  of course...i have a lot of seed packets...and this raised bed gardening is awesome.  i want some more of those!!
