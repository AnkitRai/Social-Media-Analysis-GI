Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/796598@N23/">Rain Gardens, Rain Barrels &amp; More</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!

It looks great and so do your plants!I need to make some of these too.This is one of the nicest rain barrel photos I have seen!This rain barrel collects water off a 7x9 foot tool shed--it is very efficient and is located right off the patio.  How did i ever live without it??  I painted it brown and have 2 more to paint--one day.  thanks for your kind remarks.
