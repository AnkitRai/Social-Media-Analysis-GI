Very exciting! I love ours too. Isn't fun!?!?!Nice garden!Looking good!!lovely!Lucky you! We are <i>still</i> having overnight freezes! Nice looking garden!Thanks for your comments everyone. This is my first garden and I am so excited.

Cindi - Still freezing at night? Well it wont be long and it will be blasting hot down your way.Wow that looks like a lot of work - those veggies are going to be so great!This looks like a great little garden in the picture here. I wonder how many hours you would have to take to work on a garden like this. It would be fun to have one but I am not sure I have the time to keep up with one. <a href="http://www.premierclean.com.au/" rel="nofollow">www.premierclean.com.au/</a>
