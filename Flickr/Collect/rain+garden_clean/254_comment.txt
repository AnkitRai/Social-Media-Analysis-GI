Hi Rae, Thanks for sharing this photo. It worked perfectly for my blog post <a href="https://estherhizsa.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/the-invisible-gardener/" rel="nofollow">estherhizsa.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/the-invisible-gardener/</a>. I provided a link to your photostream and credited you. Thanks again, Esther BTW I loved what smmydavisdog did with it. I couldn't wait to show it to my grandson! But that photo would not have worked with my post!
