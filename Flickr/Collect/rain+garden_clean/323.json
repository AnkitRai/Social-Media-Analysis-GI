Until today! \n\nAlthough my new flashgun (Sony HVL-F42AM) arrived yesterday it took until today to get it outside and take a few test shots. Trouble was, it was raining most of the day so there was scarcely a flying bee in sight, which was what I really wanted (I only saw one, briefly, in a whole hour). I'm actually terrified of spiders and wouldn't normally photograph one. However, it was a fair test because of the wind and overcast conditions; the camera was hand held and the new flash attached to the camera - in future I'll have it at a different angle and off-camera to avoid the glare.\n\nOf course, this isn't a particularly high shutter speed (1\/200) but the HVL-F42AM is capable of High Speed Sync which I hope to get into as soon as possible, given better weather for the bees and other moving object possibilities!!\n\nISO 400 (annoyingly - forgot to change it to 100); f10, 1\/200 sec.\n\nThanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bad_air\/\">AIR BUS<\/a>  for  for his help and advice on how to shoot moving insects.
