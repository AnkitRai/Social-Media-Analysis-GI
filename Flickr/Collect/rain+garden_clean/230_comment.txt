great view with the back of the house glad to hear there are more open houses on the horizon
All those lucky enough to visit your garden must be delighted by the experience!  The begonias look stunning and I can't help but marvel at the thought they are  situated in full summer sun.
What a wonderful perspective - I think the first time I've seen the garden from this angle.  And very beautiful photography - fantastic detail and colour.  The begonias are marvellous!  Amazing that you had such a wet summer and yet it hasn't affected the games - good job, UK!
The begonias almost glow.  Beautiful!  Good luck with the garden tours coming up.
Great photo, love the angle.

I love this angle!  We've had opposite summers.  Ours has been hot and humid.  It seems to have flown by.  I'm really not ready for fall.  Although, I really look forward to seeing it in your garden!
Nice .... Love it!!!
What a spectacular looking garden!! There are so many different colors and plants. It would be so fun to have a garden like this. <a href="http://www.earthwormrestumping.com.au/our-services" rel="nofollow">www.earthwormrestumping.com.au/our-services</a>
