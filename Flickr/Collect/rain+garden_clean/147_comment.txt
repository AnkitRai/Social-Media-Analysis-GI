Oh!  It's a wonderful Garden!!
Thank you, Bluesrose@ Thank you, Jackie Ramo! ...and thanks to you OKI-T ! You are a find...a treasure...with all your knowledge about plants!  I love your site, and I drool over your camellia photos! Your father is/was a great horticulturalist...if Yahirobotan is ever offered for sale, I'd love to have one...even a small one! That color!!!!!
These are beautiful --- what a delightful waking-in-the-spring garden.  (Makes me think of Frances Hodgeson Burnett's The Secret Garden, the children's delight in finding that the garden is all alive!)
Kind of wild and very wet at the moment, Jinx! I Ilke the Secret Garden analogy! (wondering why Chris keeps one of my teabowls on a post...?!)
