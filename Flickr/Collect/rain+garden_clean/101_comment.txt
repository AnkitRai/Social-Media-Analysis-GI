Actually Dennis dear it's Acer palmatum bloodgood but I can understand your mistake ;)    Bonsai?!!!  Terrible thing to do to trees - bind their limbs, sever their roots, make them deformed deliberately - shocking!!!!!  Your poor little tree must have trembled every time you walked into the room :(
Surely if you had bonsaid the poor thing then it would have fitted in the house or in a conservatory.  Full size would cope outdoors certainly but would a poor, deliberately deformed specimen not have had difficulty?
A frozen root-ball is most certainly something to be very wary of.
Lovely garden Donna! Even the potted plants and trees. The grass is always greener... and still grows and grows with the rain!
Thank you Vicky although in this shot it looks far neater than it actually is - the camera does lie, lol, or at least it can mislead :)
I do wish I had cut my grass last Wednesday! It has grown 6 inches in three days!!!
Sandi I can well believe it!!  I did this last Friday but about 3 days later it looked due for another cut.
Fair point Dennis ;)
