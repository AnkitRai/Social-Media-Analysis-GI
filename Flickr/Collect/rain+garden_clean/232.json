They gardened, shelled clams, buried people, gathered  wild rice, etc., here.  The woods and the evidence of the village is now a preserve with nice walking trails.  I often walk by this collection of large boulders and notice how colorful they get after a rain.  The lichens and mosses really green up.\n\nWhich brings up the question---where did they come from.  Well, after the indians left the farmers cleared the land and the boulders for crops.  These rocks were deposited here decades ago.\n\nI often walk out among the boulders and sit and relax for a period of time. It is a great way to calm your mind and body.  Nature really has restorative powers.\n\nI made this image with my Pentax K5 and Pentax 18-135mm lens.  Processing was done in Aperture 3 and NIK Color Efex Pro 4.\n\nCamera settings:  ISO 800, Aperture f\/8, shutter 1\/125, focal length 18mm\n\ncolorful boulders\ncollected by early farmers\nlit up by the rain\n\nImage and haiku by John Henry Gremmer\n"},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1367596468","taken":"2013-04-23 10:29:34","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1398903217"},"views":"1970","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":1,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":1},"comments":{"_content":"19"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"44949234-8705253640-351","author":"45042047@N08","authorname":"J Henry G","raw":"USA","_content":"usa","machine_tag":0},{"id":"44949234-8705253640-791","author":"45042047@N08","authorname":"J Henry G","raw":"nature","_content":"nature","machine_tag":0},{"id":"44949234-8705253640-12163","author":"45042047@N08","authorname":"J Henry G","raw":"boulders","_content":"boulders","machine_tag":0},{"id":"44949234-8705253640-2562","author":"45042047@N08","authorname":"J Henry G","raw":"moss","_content":"moss","machine_tag":0},{"id":"44949234-8705253640-43212","author":"45042047@N08","authorname":"J Henry G","raw":"lichens","_content":"lichens","machine_tag":0},{"id":"44949234-8705253640-931","author":"45042047@N08","authorname":"J Henry G","raw":"rain","_content":"rain","machine_tag":0},{"id":"44949234-8705253640-22058","author":"45042047@N08","authorname":"J Henry G","raw":"Indians","_content":"indians","machine_tag":0},{"id":"44949234-8705253640-63172480","author":"45042047@N08","authorname":"J Henry G","raw":"John Henry Gremmer","_content":"johnhenrygremmer","machine_tag":0},{"id":"44949234-8705253640-904181","author":"45042047@N08","authorname":"J Henry G","raw":"Winneconne","_content":"winneconne","machine_tag":0}]},"location":{"latitude":"44.129985","longitude":"-88.696060","accuracy":"16","context":"0","neighbourhood":{"_content":"Lasleys Point","place_id":"1tHLEyJTVrmG9Jte","woeid":"2436781"},"locality":{"_content":"Winneconne","place_id":"mH.y7e1TV7hXPHc2","woeid":"2522147"},"county":{"_content":"Winnebago","place_id":"h8q.KIZQUL.MCU_I4g","woeid":"12590604"},"region":{"_content":"Wisconsin","place_id":"3cBQPq9TUb6FvPAL","woeid":"2347608"},"country":{"_content":"United States","place_id":"nz.gsghTUb4c2WAecA","woeid":"23424977"},"place_id":"1tHLEyJTVrmG9Jte","woeid":"2436781"},"geoperms":{"ispublic":1,"iscontact":0,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage","_content":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/j_henry_g\/8705253640\/"}]},"media":"photo"},"stat":"ok"}
