This seemed like a pretty good spot and I liked this comp.  I can just image what it looked like two weeks after this.\n\nThis is my last posting from my first Oregon\/Washington trip and I can see why it's such a photographer's haven.  I'm definitely returning next year, probably in spring to shoot Palouse and maybe some wildflowers.  Thanks for all the nice comments on the prevous shots as well!\n\nCanon 5D mkII, Canon 17-40 f4@31mm, f18@4 sec, ISO 160, Polarizer"},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1351869114","taken":"2012-10-15 14:56:28","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1423768931"},"views":"2651","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":1,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":1},"comments":{"_content":"22"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"41863265-8147837895-397","author":"41956078@N08","authorname":"TomGrubbe","raw":"house","_content":"house","machine_tag":0},{"id":"41863265-8147837895-1304","author":"41956078@N08","authorname":"TomGrubbe","raw":"creek","_content":"creek","machine_tag":0},{"id":"41863265-8147837895-1445","author":"41956078@N08","authorname":"TomGrubbe","raw":"river","_content":"river","machine_tag":0},{"id":"41863265-8147837895-171351","author":"41956078@N08","authorname":"TomGrubbe","raw":"lewis river","_content":"lewisriver","machine_tag":0},{"id":"41863265-8147837895-2407","author":"41956078@N08","authorname":"TomGrubbe","raw":"washington","_content":"washington","machine_tag":0},{"id":"41863265-8147837895-33352","author":"41956078@N08","authorname":"TomGrubbe","raw":"washington state","_content":"washingtonstate","machine_tag":0},{"id":"41863265-8147837895-931","author":"41956078@N08","authorname":"TomGrubbe","raw":"rain","_content":"rain","machine_tag":0},{"id":"41863265-8147837895-1311","author":"41956078@N08","authorname":"TomGrubbe","raw":"forest","_content":"forest","machine_tag":0},{"id":"41863265-8147837895-167","author":"41956078@N08","authorname":"TomGrubbe","raw":"autumn","_content":"autumn","machine_tag":0},{"id":"41863265-8147837895-613","author":"41956078@N08","authorname":"TomGrubbe","raw":"fall","_content":"fall","machine_tag":0},{"id":"41863265-8147837895-1695","author":"41956078@N08","authorname":"TomGrubbe","raw":"landscape","_content":"landscape","machine_tag":0}]},"location":{"latitude":"45.834017","longitude":"-122.494404","accuracy":"15","context":"0","locality":{"_content":"Heisson","place_id":"BM2D4V9TVrvQS0Bh","woeid":"2419714"},"county":{"_content":"Clark","place_id":".Wh_vIFQUL.l3OgBfQ","woeid":"12590445"},"region":{"_content":"Washington","place_id":"jyADg3RTUb65Hnbj","woeid":"2347606"},"country":{"_content":"United States","place_id":"nz.gsghTUb4c2WAecA","woeid":"23424977"},"place_id":"BM2D4V9TVrvQS0Bh","woeid":"2419714"},"geoperms":{"ispublic":1,"iscontact":0,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage","_content":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/tomgrubbe\/8147837895\/"}]},"media":"photo"},"stat":"ok"}
