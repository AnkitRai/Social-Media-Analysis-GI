Saturday was perfect - 70 degrees, a slight breeze, with the air full of birdsong. Sunday rains moved through and Monday morning was cold and rainy as we were leaving. If you've always wanted to see dogwoods and azaleas like they have at the Masters Golf Tournament, this is one of the places to come.\n\nI was fortunate enough to hear a talk by the great English plantsman Roy Lancaster when he visited here about 15 years ago. He said these gardens reminded him of the Valley Gardens at Windsor Great Park.\n\nHere is a link to the official site for the gardens:\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.callawaygardens.com\/callaway\/info\/accom.aspx?gclid=CL..\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.callawaygardens.com\/callaway\/info\/accom.aspx?gclid=CL..<\/a>.\n\n"},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1239526062","taken":"2009-04-04 13:28:39","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1331580323"},"views":"7825","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":1,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":1},"comments":{"_content":"78"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"22802515-3434155664-1586","author":"22834654@N04","authorname":"UGArdener","raw":"Easter","_content":"easter","machine_tag":0},{"id":"22802515-3434155664-271454","author":"22834654@N04","authorname":"UGArdener","raw":"Callaway Gardens","_content":"callawaygardens","machine_tag":0},{"id":"22802515-3434155664-3864","author":"22834654@N04","authorname":"UGArdener","raw":"Azaleas","_content":"azaleas","machine_tag":0},{"id":"22802515-3434155664-13347","author":"22834654@N04","authorname":"UGArdener","raw":"Pines","_content":"pines","machine_tag":0}]},"location":{"latitude":"32.830089","longitude":"-84.844880","accuracy":"14","context":"0","locality":{"_content":"Pine Mountain","place_id":"8J7LwixTVr2sis0L","woeid":"2472311"},"county":{"_content":"Harris","place_id":"0ZQkN.hQUL_UERf4Bw","woeid":"12587941"},"region":{"_content":"Georgia","place_id":"Nmka7bxTUb7ZdRiB","woeid":"2347569"},"country":{"_content":"United States","place_id":"nz.gsghTUb4c2WAecA","woeid":"23424977"},"place_id":"8J7LwixTVr2sis0L","woeid":"2472311"},"geoperms":{"ispublic":1,"iscontact":0,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage","_content":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/ugardener\/3434155664\/"}]},"media":"photo"},"stat":"ok"}
