I have had flooding and the West side yard is a constantly flowing river, upending rocks and stepping stones and churning channels, while the East side yard is a standing pool of water.  Not pleasant.  \n\nYes, we need the rain -- Texas has been drought-plagued for the past three years -- but so far all of this hasn't had any kind of measurable effect on lake and other water levels. \n\nOther than the flooding damage and annoyance, the effect in the garden has been freakishly tall plant growth.  It looks jungle-like.  \n\nThe canna lilies have not been able to hold up their heads -- probably a dozen of them have fallen under their burden and the stalks look like they've been twisted.  I've tried staking them and taping them -- nothing has worked.  The photo in comments section shows some of the fallen stalks in the front where they're visible.
