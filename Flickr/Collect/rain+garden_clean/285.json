There were only ten spots available, and we had full reign over the gardens. The event allows you to drag in your equipment such as a tripod and lights! This is the first time I have ever visited and it was cool to have the gardens essentially to myself from 8-10AM! \n\n  I have been looking forward to this all week but was worried about the big storms we have coming in! Well, the big wind storm will be tonight, but this morning just had light rain. THE WHOLE TIME! When ten o'clock rolled around, the rain conveniently stopped! I did not mind the rain or the overcast skies, but wound up battling humidity buildup on my circular polarizer. \n\n  I liked this little pathway that divided before reaching the little stone bridge. I felt that the lamppost kind of gave this a &quot;Thomas Kinkade&quot; sort of feel to it. I know his painting have more of a soft glow and I went with a little added contrast. I burned through two memory cards and will have more to post later. \n\n  This is a combination of three exposures (-2,0,+2) merged and tonemapped in Photomatix. Cropped in Photoshop, and ran through Topaz Adjust for details. Final vignetting in Lightroom with a decreased saturation of several colors due to the HDR processing.\n\n  As always, I appreciate your visits, comments and faves. I hope you enjoy viewing this photo as much as I had taking it. Thank you and have a great, rest of the weekend. I will be battening down the hatches in preparation for our first big windstorm of the fall!"},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1287882466","taken":"2010-10-23 08:12:46","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1413902245"},"views":"4213","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":0,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":1},"comments":{"_content":"40"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"38509248-5108612677-11177417","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Seattle Japanese Gardens","_content":"seattlejapanesegardens","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-53338","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Japanese Gardens","_content":"japanesegardens","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-6684808","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Autumn in Seattle","_content":"autumninseattle","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-69","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Seattle","_content":"seattle","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-167","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Autumn","_content":"autumn","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-613","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Fall","_content":"fall","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-544","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Color","_content":"color","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-987","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Yellow","_content":"yellow","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-340","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Orange","_content":"orange","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-227","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Red","_content":"red","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-22268","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Lamplight","_content":"lamplight","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-56210","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"HDR","_content":"hdr","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-19571813","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Canon Rebel XSI","_content":"canonrebelxsi","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-1019569","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Photomatix","_content":"photomatix","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-26782773","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Topaz Adjust","_content":"topazadjust","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-12204940","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Lightroom2","_content":"lightroom2","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-44963317","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Fresnatic","_content":"fresnatic","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-17997","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Pacific Northwest","_content":"pacificnorthwest","machine_tag":0},{"id":"38509248-5108612677-33352","author":"38529596@N02","authorname":"Fresnatic","raw":"Washington State","_content":"washingtonstate","machine_tag":0}]},"location":{"latitude":"47.633961","longitude":"-122.295534","accuracy":"14","context":"0","locality":{"_content":"Seattle","place_id":"uiZgkRVTVrMaF2cP","woeid":"2490383"},"county":{"_content":"King","place_id":"e4JdbCFQUL8iSf0rtg","woeid":"12590456"},"region":{"_content":"Washington","place_id":"jyADg3RTUb65Hnbj","woeid":"2347606"},"country":{"_content":"United States","place_id":"nz.gsghTUb4c2WAecA","woeid":"23424977"},"place_id":"uiZgkRVTVrMaF2cP","woeid":"2490383"},"geoperms":{"ispublic":1,"iscontact":0,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage","_content":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/fresnatic\/5108612677\/"}]},"media":"photo"},"stat":"ok"}
