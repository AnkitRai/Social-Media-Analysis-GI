That it feels like a sauna.... and it's only May.... well, that's not so nice :-(  
I bought one little orange icelandic  poppy 2 weeks ago.  The blooms are so bright and airy.  Thanks for encouraging me to try some.  and now, I'll try a few more.Wow, is that incredible! Once more I have to say I can't believe the time, patience and love you put into cultivating, planting, pruning and weeding this spot of Heaven into the awesome place it is!! You should be very proud of all your efforts and wish you congrats on Explore!! Well deserved!I have always wondered why I can't have a garden real as yours, but only a large flowerbed that during this time is brimming with roses, then, for the rest of the year, has only the topinambur, solanum and few other.One reason is that I do not have a raised flower bed like the one that your son-in-law brought you , so, also if I'm buying some flowers in the nursery,I' settling them in great vessels but never in the land: too tiring. Despite having more or less a good portion of your annuals ...this not make garden!   :(They do seem to be bearing up well.Your garden is looking gorgeous!
