It will freshen everything up for you!it is hot here, but the highs are only 32c . . . and I'm wishing it was 10 degrees cooler!Your garden looks cool and refreshing despite the heat.  We had a record high temperature for July here yesterday.  July is usually our coldest month but yesterday was a mild 23 deg C!Lovely image of your garden, Patricia.  I'm happy the rains came :-)  We have been experiencing a heat wave all this week, hopefully it will break over the weekend.Even with that punishing heat, your garden still has lots of color! I love this out-of-doors room...I would be willing to brave the Texas sauna to sit on one of your inviting stone chairs.Looks so refreshed, beautiful.Yah for rain!It is amazing you have so many flowers and so much lush green foliage despite the intense sunshine and prolonged heat!  

In the UK this  July has been the first hot summer month for  several years ....... the sunshine has been virtually continuous but what we call hot is 21C - 29C!

But the rain is welcome, and your garden still looks lovely.Is rain a treat after weeks of hot weather? Your garden looks refreshed.Beautiful spot and it is nice to have rain after sweltering heat.

About the baby Bluebirds in our yard. They may stay around a little while after they fledge, but the poppa will eventually drive them off as they are pretty territorial. Though last year the third brood fledglings hung around for some time.such a pretty shot of your garden Pat!
I think the only thing that's saved my garden through this insane heat wave was the fact that we had so much rain before hand.Your garden looks beautiful in the rain, so green and healthy looking, not a withered plant in sight! What a relief to get rain after that terrific heat. We are having along stretch of sunny days and temps up to 35C but the nights cool off.Your garden is looking so healthy and lush !!!
Weather here like at UK  [http://www.flickr.com/photos/fourseasonsgarden] .Despite being subjected to really high temps (I just don't know how you cope), your garden looks amazing.   This is a lovely spot;  a peaceful corner to just chill out.  Great photo Patricia.Hooray for rain! I love your gardens, and i love the limestone! So inviting.The limestone is such a gorgeous part of your garden and hope you've got plenty of rain so far to keep everything alive and flourishing!Lovely shot of your beautiful garden.  We have had a few cloudy and cooler days and more rain that we really needed too.  It is so nice, but I miss the warmth and bright sun if I don't have it very often.
