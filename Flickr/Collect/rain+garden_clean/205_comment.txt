Love your wonderful spring-greens!:-)
Have a nice day!Wonderful composition ...!!Well done friend..Beautiful garden Ken, but I'd hate to have to trim all those topiary hedges or cut the grass with my liddle lawnmower!My!  This would take some looking after!

Lovely.I wish my garden was like this, well sort of anyway.
