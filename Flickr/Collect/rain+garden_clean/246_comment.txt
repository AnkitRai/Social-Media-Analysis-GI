Lovely Spring mood and light, Carol.wonderful mood &amp; atmosphere Carol!I love this image.  You must be glad you got all those lovely shots of the pretty white blossoms before the rain stripped them!  And yet you've made still another beautiful photo with the petals alone . . . a drift of petals.  I really like your title, too.A beautiful Zen setting..very intimate with naturegreat light and frameVery peaceful scene! What a pleasant place to drift (and not a spike in sight).How romantic!!!!!Seriously?  Is this what your backyard looks like?  Oh my goodness gracious.  It's a little slice of heaven here on earth is what it is.  What a joy it must be to sit with a cup of coffee, hot chocolate, a cocktail or even a cup of tea while enjoying that space.  It looks so very inviting and comfortable.  <i>Nicely done</i>.
