What a glorious view!!  Congratulations on all of the visitors that you've welcomed and all the money you've raised for charity.  You two are amazing!!!

It's beautiful at any time and I think it's so wonderful that you have raised so much money for charities!
All the views are delightful, I am not sure which one I like the best.  Many congratulations on raising so much money for your chosen charities, for which I am sure they are extremely grateful.

Beautiful set and well done once again on your successful open day.
The spring and autumn views are wonderful.  I get such a kick out of your photographs.
You've made a mistake in the title... it should be 'Pathway through Heaven'
