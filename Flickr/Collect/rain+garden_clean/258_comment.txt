I have faved and tagged your picture with <b>BRAVO</b> and this serves as an invitation to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/thebestbravo/">The Best: BRAVO</a> -- pending administrative review.this is one of those scenes that make me glad I became a shutter bug.  you came across a place and composed it as it was, including the welcoming bench as part of the scene when most would walk past it to get it 'out of the way'.  terrific photo.  :-)Easy to imagine and anticipate my wife and me sitting here next fall when we visit ONP. Great preview and beautiful shot Phil! Gives a great sense for the lushness of the place. Perfectly composed...as usual.what a beautiful scene you captured here Phil!  love the moss on the fence and how you framed the beach through the trees.  have a wonderful weekend my friend.Wonderful photographic viewing point.  And you can sit down for a rest if you need it too!  
Olympic National Park is absolutely one of my favorite places.  There really are a lot of &quot;mini parks&quot; within, each with its own personality.
Beautiful shades of green here and although fences often detract from the view, in this case I think it actually enhances it.Love this composition Phil.  Like a visit in many dimensions.  Can't stop the eye from jumping towards the horizon while my butt wants to sit here on that bench.  Beautiful my friend.

denisOkay, I'm envisioning placing a lovely couple(like your wife and you) sitting on this unique log bench facing me, with the wonderful landscape in the background!! I guess then you might miss the water area and cliff, though, so then I would ask them to get up and take this shot! LOL I love the lushness of the area, Phil! It was so dry where we were in Santa Cruz, yesterday. Soon we will have more rain, and hopefully spruce things up even more! Have a super weekend, my friend!beautiful. love the depth of the picture.I will, thank you!  Actually, I did sit right there to lace up my shoe!  This is fabulous, Phil.....clarity is out of sight!  I'm not in Tetons nor am I in Canada.....I have just been forgetting to update file info.  I'm home in Washington, must stop Flickring and get to housecleaning!  Yuk!  I have a houseful of people coming for Thanksgiving and I'm playing Flickr!  For shame!  Have a beautiful weekend!!!Great depth ! Have a nice weekend !What a beautiful spot and you really brought out the rainy day colors.  Just gorgeousOne of Phil's iconic benches, with a fantastic view to go with it!wow! Olympic nat park?! wish i was there with you :)Wish I had discovered this spot in person. It is awesomeI love the lush greens of Olympic! And you can't have that lushness without quite a bit of rain. Hope you're having a great weekend, Phil.This is wonderful Phil ! The colors are so beautiful.
