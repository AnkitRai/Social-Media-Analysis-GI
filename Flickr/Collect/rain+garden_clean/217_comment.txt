This is wonderful.  We haven't had rain for so long that my yard looks like the grand canyon!   Have a great weekend.Looks like a cloister walk in a monastery. How pretty!Looks like an inviting place. Lovely framing of grape vines.Nice capture of the recent rain Dave , it does look lush.Love the composition here!Neat passageway, although apparently it doesn't really provide much protection from either sun or shower!This looks inviting, rain or not.Great capture!Beautiful shot, Dave.  I was there about 10 days ago for the first time, so I've now seen this with my own eyes!  Such a beautiful place!!!Viewed in large it shows some of the fruits on the grape vines. Looks very nice
