Like the rainy day!   Rain made this image special.   Thanks for your effort!Thanks and I love rainy day photography.  Every since I had my Nikon D200 (weather sealed) and D7000 (also sealed) I have loved having that capability.

If the Olympus E-M5 didn't offer that I'd never have bought it.  Now I just need some better weather sealed lenses.  The kit lens is and does fine work but falls short of &quot;greatness&quot; and the clarity needed for large prints -- although, really I had such a deal keeping the filter wiped off I'm not sure it would have made a big difference this day!
