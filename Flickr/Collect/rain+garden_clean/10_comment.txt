Nice! Love salamanders!
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/52014195@N08] Thanks, Tim. There's a nice little article in the NY Times 'Science Times' (April 8) on the benefits of salamanders that you might enjoy.
I read that! Good article.
Nice! I am able to pick your photos out of the contact's stream now, as you so often have the delicious greens.
Lovely green mini landscape!

Lovely shot of all the Spring greenery, Ed.
