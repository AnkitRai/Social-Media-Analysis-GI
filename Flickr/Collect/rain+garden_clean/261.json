Your mainstream media normally avoids the real news  so you will not panic or scared to death .You watch your football ,sports hero ,your beautiful singing idols , soaps , holiday -travel programmes , all those mind numbing programs on TV ,as if things are  all the same as it was .Well if you think nothing but all the same as it was,then you must well be dosy ,past asleep or truly blind.  If you don't have Christ and is certain  you are save,you'll be afraid ,be very afraid of the times ahead. If you are afraid of death ,then you aren't save. Because if you have Christ in your heart and is born of Christ in the spirit ( a truly born -again christian ) there is no fear in you and of  whatsoever to befall on  you and your family at latter days,even death .\n\nIf we see evil now ,this isn't the evil which is described that will happen during the tribulation days .I do believe we are at the birth pangs yet,though we don't know how long this be and the degree of anguish and disaster it will take the world over. The evil we see now are yet little tasters of days to come . When the restrainer is taken away ,the Holy spirit which  takes control of things of this world as of this time ,it will be hell break loose.This was all said in the Biblcal terms thousands of years before.If you didn't continue partying ,  fornicating or succomb to temptation of the adulterous Jezzibel spirit , you'd never fall sleep, even to much extent mocking and making ridicule ,ignoring the warnings of God . Some do believe once stature and knowledge can save them, believing almost they are like gods ,little gods. \n\n\nDon't even think of the &quot;end time&quot; idea if you don't like it,but just think if your breathe of life be taken away any time today ,where you are going to spend your eternity. It is something you don't have to speculate ,rather be sure where you stand today and where you are spendin your eternity . Man has a spirit and this is eternal element of man. If you don't have Christ Jesus truly in your life and you're not born in the spirit ,then you are lost spiritually.\nI know this is a heavy talk  but I'd rather have people poked and nudge ,even offended if only this message could help  wake them up ,than go my quiet comfortable way and  flatter them nicely  to hell .\n\nIf you don't have Christ ,you better seek Him truly now before it's too late.\n\nI am doing this with loved and as a work for Christ to share the gospel by any means ,even through this little corner in flickr.That when I face God in the beama seat of judgement of saints ,I knew I have done something for the Lord and never embarrased at any time to admit I am a Christian and I'm with Jesus here in flickr .\n\n\n<u><b>Bizarre News <\/b><\/u>:\n\n\n\n<b><a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/553QinK8tBs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oregon: Farmer Eaten By &quot;Zombie Hogs&quot; Bible Signs! <\/a><\/b>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b><a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/dLVMsrWI7qg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michigan State University  Professor Running Naked In Class &quot;There Is No (Beep) God<\/a><\/b>\n\n\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<u>Sign of The Times Videos<\/u> \n\n\n* <b><a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/upQkfADSYfM\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Heart of Disobedience - Psalm 82 &quot;Ye are gods&quot; <\/a><\/b> of ClayEudaly\n\n\n\n\n\n* <b><a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/wFeDfWFaTxM\" rel=\"nofollow\">World War 3 Scenario report: Oct. 1\/2012 (Part 1)<\/a><\/b>\n\n\n\n\n\n* <b><a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/_nS9Rrrnwfw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muslim Brotherhood Looks To Overthrow The King of Jordan.

Isn't the word of God true ,shaming all those which dicredit the Bible .What would happen to America ,we don't know .But this is what the scene would look like. Bible prophecy orientated christians are watching things unfold in our very interesting times. We should not be afraid to see dark things happening ,even real persecutions of true christians which uphold the true teachings from the world of God to come to pass."},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1349188617","taken":"2012-07-28 02:44:00","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1409897907"},"views":"13385","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":1},"usage":{"candownload":0,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":0},"comments":{"_content":"45"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"4560206-8047267913-6412","author":"32059995@N00","authorname":"pickled_newt ( busy again on n off B)","raw":"Philippines","_content":"philippines","machine_tag":0},{"id":"4560206-8047267913-24814114","author":"32059995@N00","authorname":"pickled_newt ( busy again on n off B)","raw":"Balanan lake","_content":"balananlake","machine_tag":0},{"id":"4560206-8047267913-520637","author":"32059995@N00","authorname":"pickled_newt ( busy again on n off B)","raw":"Mountain Resort","_content":"mountainresort","machine_tag":0},{"id":"4560206-8047267913-678","author":"32059995@N00","authorname":"pickled_newt ( busy again on n off B)","raw":"tourism","_content":"tourism","machine_tag":0},{"id":"4560206-8047267913-931","author":"32059995@N00","authorname":"pickled_newt ( busy again on n off B)","raw":"rain","_content":"rain","machine_tag":0},{"id":"4560206-8047267913-3889","author":"32059995@N00","authorname":"pickled_newt ( busy again on n off B)","raw":"rainy day","_content":"rainyday","machine_tag":0},{"id":"4560206-8047267913-1944452","author":"32059995@N00","authorname":"pickled_newt ( busy again on n off B)","raw":"Siaton","_content":"siaton","machine_tag":0},{"id":"4560206-8047267913-66550731","author":"32059995@N00","authorname":"pickled_newt ( busy again on n off B)","raw":"southern negros oriental","_content":"southernnegrosoriental","machine_tag":0},{"id":"4560206-8047267913-1870","author":"32059995@N00","authorname":"pickled_newt ( busy again on n off B)","raw":"Island","_content":"island","machine_tag":0},{"id":"4560206-8047267913-8192329","author":"32059995@N00","authorname":"pickled_newt ( busy again on n off B)","raw":"central visayas","_content":"centralvisayas","machine_tag":0},{"id":"4560206-8047267913-98461072","author":"32059995@N00","authorname":"pickled_newt ( busy again on n off B)","raw":"Balanan mountain resort","_content":"balananmountainresort","machine_tag":0},{"id":"4560206-8047267913-401","author":"32059995@N00","authorname":"pickled_newt ( busy again on n off B)","raw":"holiday","_content":"holiday","machine_tag":0}]},"location":{"latitude":"9.197681","longitude":"123.024215","accuracy":"11","context":"0","region":{"_content":"Central Visayas","place_id":"KRwBoAlTUb4piuY7Ew","woeid":"23424721"},"country":{"_content":"Philippines","place_id":"oJ7Zd4BTUb7DgCfdxQ","woeid":"23424934"},"place_id":"KRwBoAlTUb4piuY7Ew","woeid":"23424721"},"geoperms":{"ispublic":1,"iscontact":0,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage","_content":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/pickled_newt\/8047267913\/"}]},"media":"photo"},"stat":"ok"}
