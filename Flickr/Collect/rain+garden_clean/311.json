My senses become immersed in the balance between nature and humanity as my eyes are treated to wonders only nature can provide. Hues of evergreen pine and eucalyptus were a delight to my olfactory system and as I traversed the floor of this ancient forest it seemed as if, for a moment, i was in the mystical Forest Moon of Endor.  \nUndoubtedly, \nCalifornia's Coastal Redwood trees &quot;Sequoia Sempervirens&quot; are some of Californias tallest and oldest residents living 1200-1800 years or more and stretching up to 379 feet in height. Mystic and beautiful, these trees reign supreme dominating the northern california coast. I was happy to make this Image and I can promise there will be more of scenes like these in the future. \nEnjoy!\n\nSony Alpha a390 DSLR\nRokinon 14mm F2.8 ultrawide lens\n"},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1364775455","taken":"2013-03-30 19:23:42","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1390834052"},"views":"24126","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":1},"usage":{"candownload":1,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":1},"comments":{"_content":"37"},"notes":{"note":[{"id":"72157633134714693","author":"48048313@N02","authorname":"j-dub1980(THANK YOU FOR 100k+ Views)","x":"2","y":"199","w":"185","h":"120","_content":"Ferns in the foreground are my favorite part of this image.
