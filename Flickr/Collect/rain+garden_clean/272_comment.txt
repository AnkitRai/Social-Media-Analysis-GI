(Come add your photo to the Weekly Showcase!)&quot;</b></a></i> <em>(<a href="http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html" rel="nofollow">?</a>)</em>summer is oozing from every pixel in this shot<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/32/buddyicons/91919735@N00.jpg?1132327569#91919735@N00" height="24" width="24" /> Dearest lovely Isabelle; <b>THANK YOU!</b> I didn't know it was my birthday today but if you say so..... 
....And you sent me a most wonderful, totally and utterly 'over-the-top' pre-birthday present.... I nearly fell over (the box and the idea)! Three home made 'confitures' (preserves), wonderful tiny biscuits, SWISS choco balls and a funny 'tag' AND a most lovely card.... How much can you spoil a girl?! :)

You're too much girl; je n'en revien plus! MERCI (c'tait bien de se parler au tlphone, cela m'a aussi encore fait du bien!)

But now you'll have to congratulate again in ..... about 6 weeks or so?!Oh Kiki :((( je suis dsole de mon erreur but so happy to have talked to you for a moment :))) There is something positive in every action, right ? Have a lovely end of this sunny Sunday and know I have written down the right day for the right person ;)) Lots of love.<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/52/buddyicons/24424426@N00.jpg?1225791245#24424426@N00" height="24" width="24" /> Thanks Jason, no envy, please - we DO have summers in France LOL!!!! (just bluffing really.... it's too hot to be serious)Such lovely pops of color Kiki.  The picture you painted with your words took me to where you are.  I must say that I am always saying &quot;Don`t start thinking of your answer until I finish&quot;  LOL  The wonderful art of listening seems way undervalued these days. (at least in my world)  You see that`s part of what I did for a living and I always knew that people solve their own problems.  It was my job to help them get to that place:-)  Oh yes, Kiki, we share the love of sudoku.  I simply must have two a day:-)<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2238/buddyicons/7272154@N05.jpg?1204402440#7272154@N05" height="24" width="24" /> Mary Beth...... you made me laugh again! The title is NOT really my life device; it is just something I encounter so often that it nearly has become a 'way of living'... and I DO interrupt my husband frequently, but so does he... one of our best liked phrases, when discussing with each other, is: .... May I PLEASE finish my sentence.... Thank you!.... It works a treat and is always a show stopper (for about 5 seconds!)

Thank You for your lovely statement - shall think of you when I do my sudoku tomorrow morning, IN THE VERANDA!Such wonderful sentiments--they align perfectly with this warm, inviting photo.  Just beautiful, Kiki. :)Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1091166@N24/">***F L O R***  - A Special Garden   ( Admin Invite )</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!

ja, wo man verstanden wird...
und das ist garnicht so einfach, weil man sich immer in andere Leute &quot;hinein&quot; denken muss, um sie zu verstehen.
man kann einfach nicht andere beurteilein, von unserem eigenen Standpunkt aus und das wollen die meisten nicht wahr haben
 
musste lachen wegen spanisch
hahaha

Ich werde jetzt nach Chile fahren und dort wird natrlich spanisch gesprochen
Wenn ich zurck komme, werde ich EXPERT sein und dann nehme ich dich als Schlerin.
Passt es dir?
Ok,
Bis dann
:))))))

Alles Liebe, Kiki

Ich liebe diesen GartenHappy Scarlet Sunday to you, Kiki, at least I hope it was, as yours is now over and mine nearly so. I think your greenhouse is a bit like mine (mine's not a greenhouse at all, though, but just a garden and a screened lanai) , but here the red geraniums (which along with pink snapdragons remind me in the best of ways of my Grandmother) well, the geraniums just can't stand the heat of a Florida summer, but it will soon be time again for flowers and tomatoes and all of those good things. The world is a beautiful place, yes....Happy happy birthday!  Looks so joyful, I love the blue color of the vase playing with the red flowers!Thank you for finding me Kiki (or I suppose I should thank Sharon for introducing you to me!) Your work is incredible my new friend! I will definitely be marking you as a contact! I also find it hard to keep up with more than 100 contacts at any given time....it's like a part time job, this Flickrville!  Nice to meet as well!  m-Oh my dear... first of all: I love your tags!!! :-D

And then... I'm in awe of your dreamy image and also of the quotes and your own words... so moving and deeply touching, for &quot;Heimat&quot; is a huge theme for me, too... thank you for sharing your thoughts and emotions!

Und tausend Dank auch fr deine wunderbaren Worte zu meinen Meer-Bildern... ich hab auch gleich wieder zu trumen angefangen! :-)

Je te souhaite une journe merveilleuse et un cur plein de soleil!Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/468472@N25/">SIR HENRY AND CO... (Award 1) - ** VOTE ** AUGUST  FP CONTEST &quot;</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!

je te souhaite une trs bonne semaine

Ich bin eben erst von meiner suche nach dem glck zurckgekehrt
mit meiner liebe

LoL

gros bisous
SaSH

Wow, your days sound fabulous!  I spent all day yesterday working.  You left quite a fun and wonderful comment on my stream which always makes me curious (seeing as how I like people who leave such comments) so I read your profile :o)  I'm a bit jealous of all the languages you know!  I must hold fast to my plans to learn at least one other than my own...  This shot is serene and beautiful, as are many of the others I saw on your photostream.  Have a great week!Should your birthday be as colourful, as cheerful as this picture!<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3063/buddyicons/21344172@N08.jpg?1248273112#21344172@N08" height="24" width="24" /> oh sweetheart, don't be jealous.....

And I love what you said about your Hero Husband. I feel the same about mine. Where he goes... I go :-)What a wonderful home in the home  --  you seem to live in it.
What a great home you live in.LOVE this composition!  Just yesterday I found a miniature greenhouse reduced from $30.00 to $7!  HAD to have it!  Now I will have the pleasure of filling it too!  Is this REALLY part of your home?  Soooo lovely!You do seem blessed on many counts.
(I hope you touch wood sometimes!)

(&quot;Where you have your papers deposited&quot;??)This does look like a nice place the while away the hours.Love this.....especially how that bright red pops right out at me!!A beautiful uplifting and smile-making composition...just terrific!
