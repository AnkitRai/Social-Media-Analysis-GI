It was a bit more challenging than anticipated as it was on a slope which required more &quot;engineering&quot; .. It does seem to be working however.  The central area is more moist than the edges which it should be according to the rain garden literature.  The rain water comes from a down spout into a rain barrel and then into a &quot;soaker&quot; hose to the garden.  Any other runoff going into a rock filled &quot;well&quot; and then into the rain garden. \n\n- John Lindsay\n\n"},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1377621667","taken":"2012-08-17 14:51:40","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1377621668"},"views":"1308","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":1,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":1},"comments":{"_content":"0"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"44103726-9609551366-20524","author":"44196539@N08","authorname":"Coalition for a Liveable Sudbury","raw":"Sudbury","_content":"sudbury","machine_tag":0},{"id":"44103726-9609551366-125224","author":"44196539@N08","authorname":"Coalition for a Liveable Sudbury","raw":"CLS","_content":"cls","machine_tag":0},{"id":"44103726-9609551366-612846","author":"44196539@N08","authorname":"Coalition for a Liveable Sudbury","raw":"rain garden","_content":"raingarden","machine_tag":0},{"id":"44103726-9609551366-3284332","author":"44196539@N08","authorname":"Coalition for a Liveable Sudbury","raw":"storm water run-off","_content":"stormwaterrunoff","machine_tag":0}]},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage","_content":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/coalitionsudbury\/9609551366\/"}]},"media":"photo"},"stat":"ok"}
