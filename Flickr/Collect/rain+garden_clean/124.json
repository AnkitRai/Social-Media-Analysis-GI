You can never put your garden before your animals so when you're in a bad drought your garden is the first thing to go.\n\nWhen you love to spend time in the garden, see the colours, the growth of everything losing that means also losing a part of yourself, a part of your home and a part of your soul. It can be very emotional.\n\nWhen the drought ends and the rain returns if you have to go out and re-buy all your plants it can also get very expensive, which was why it was so nice when people donated 600 plants to Kukerin gardens recently. \n\nPeople potted them with love and kindness, and it was so nice for them to be able to do that. \n\nOnce you have the majority of your garden back, you can then go out and buy a couple of your favourite plants. \n\nThe rains have come, and most of us have water now in our dams and while be right for a year or two. \n\nI think we get so used to being kicked down and dealing with tough conditions that most of us are very resilient. There's the attitude that when times are good let's forget about the past and just move forward. It's nice then to be able to go outside and look after the garden."},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1322027787","taken":"2011-11-02 15:14:04","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1322028016"},"views":"404","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":1,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":0},"comments":{"_content":"0"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"57960919-6387501897-75094433","author":"58053732@N08","authorname":"ABC Open Great Southern WA","raw":"abcopen:project=wateris","_content":"abcopen:project=wateris","machine_tag":1},{"id":"57960919-6387501897-800","author":"58053732@N08","authorname":"ABC Open Great Southern WA","raw":"water","_content":"water","machine_tag":0},{"id":"57960919-6387501897-14870","author":"58053732@N08","authorname":"ABC Open Great Southern WA","raw":"drought","_content":"drought","machine_tag":0},{"id":"57960919-6387501897-55692","author":"58053732@N08","authorname":"ABC Open Great Southern WA","raw":"Western Australia","_content":"westernaustralia","machine_tag":0},{"id":"57960919-6387501897-349","author":"58053732@N08","authorname":"ABC Open Great Southern WA","raw":"plants","_content":"plants","machine_tag":0},{"id":"57960919-6387501897-1483","author":"58053732@N08","authorname":"ABC Open Great Southern WA","raw":"garden","_content":"garden","machine_tag":0},{"id":"57960919-6387501897-6656","author":"58053732@N08","authorname":"ABC Open Great Southern WA","raw":"farming","_content":"farming","machine_tag":0},{"id":"57960919-6387501897-931","author":"58053732@N08","authorname":"ABC Open Great Southern WA","raw":"rain","_content":"rain","machine_tag":0},{"id":"57960919-6387501897-1357020","author":"58053732@N08","authorname":"ABC Open Great Southern WA","raw":"Kukerin","_content":"kukerin","machine_tag":0}]},"location":{"latitude":"-33.187561","longitude":"118.085449","accuracy":"11","context":"0","locality":{"_content":"Kukerin","place_id":"7XJGyuJQUrPocjiW","woeid":"1096739"},"county":{"_content":"Dumbleyung","place_id":"SAQUhIdUV7LabcpcjQ","woeid":"55864077"},"region":{"_content":"Western Australia","place_id":"UyYA4yVTUb4SXtKy","woeid":"2344706"},"country":{"_content":"Australia","place_id":"3fHNxEZTUb4mc08chA","woeid":"23424748"},"place_id":"7XJGyuJQUrPocjiW","woeid":"1096739"},"geoperms":{"ispublic":1,"iscontact":0,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage","_content":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/58053732@N08\/6387501897\/"}]},"media":"photo"},"stat":"ok"}
