Happy to see you found a place to shoot. I've never seen the central courtyard this wet. Did you warm your hands over the prayer candles? :&gt;)
Too funny. No, but I did take pictures of them. ;-)
LOL...unclemojo! I like viewing the courtyard in the rain!
The kids don't seem to be worried about the rain!
