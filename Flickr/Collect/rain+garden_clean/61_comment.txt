You really did have a rainstorm!  The garden still looks lovely, though.
I saw your beautiful work in: Ho ammirato questo tuo lavoro in: <img src="http://wl.filegenie.com/~lily/icogarden.jpg" /> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/privategarden_">www.flickr.com/groups/privategarden_</a> group 
I can almost smell and hear the rain.
