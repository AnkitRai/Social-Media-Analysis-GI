Tag your photo with &quot;Nature Through The Lens&quot;Beautiful!! So rich and vibrant. Totally lush. I love the mist on the mountain. What a gorgeous place to be ! :)FantasticDet er jo vakkert med tke og yr ogs :) Dette var et flott bilde. Herlig komposisjon og blomstene i forgrunnen gjr hele bildet etter min mening. :)Beautiful Norway scene.  Great to include the flower in the foreground.
The mist adds a nice atmosphere.Lovely, Beautiful

Thank  You My  Friend

DomiDrizzling rain and gloomy clouds - you make it sound so dreary, and yet your photos show such great looking places. I have to admit, I was in Fevik, way down the southern tip of Norway just at the end of this August and people were having a swim in the sea! Gulp!  I understand the sea water was in the 15-18 degrees Celcius range (brrrrr), but which I suppose is nice and balmy for you. 

Your portfolio is amazing.Det undarlege er at  veksa opp p slike innestengde stadar ofte frer med seg eit enno vidare vidsyn seinare i livet. Sjlv er eg diverre oppvaksen i den mykje opnare Vossabygdi.

Flott og stemningsfullt.Stunning shot!
