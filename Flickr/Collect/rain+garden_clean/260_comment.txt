Diana, it looks so nice.  Really impressive -- you've done a lot of work and a lot planning went into it.  You're growing a lot of vegetables -- you'll be about self-sufficient as far as vegetables go!  They'll taste so good!You know what I love most about this garden?? THE FOREST BEHIND IT ALL!!
You've got it all there, Diana. When I retire, I will plant a garden. Hehe.
Where did you go? Someplace fun? ;)Nice! Those raised beds must make gardening a pure pleasure! Your planting choices sound great too :-)Looks like fun!  I am thinking I might have to eventually screen in some of my plants as the squirrels are eating a lot.  I have tomatoes on the vines and  peas coming up in my little garden beds.I see now why you have to have the fence. The deer would so enjoy a lettuce sandwich:):)I am so far behind. I love your garden and your poles too.  I am jealous!!!!No garden for me until I have a fence....the deer are eating everything in sight in my yard, except they leave the weeds!Your beds are really beautiful -- I mean the wood structures, not just the plants!  Hope it's getting big and green there.  X
