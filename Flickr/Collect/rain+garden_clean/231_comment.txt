Still a beautiful photo, and at least you did get some nice weather .stupid Murphy
I'm guessing you have to come back again!!poor shoes[http://www.flickr.com/photos/sapaho] I do! hahaha... ;)I bet it looked beautiful....have never seen a tulip farm.Very nice, is this Table Cape?  We were there last Monday and I know exactly what you mean about the mud!  Luckily it stopped raining for a little while when we were there but my shoes still have mud on them.  Love the processing on this shot.[http://www.flickr.com/photos/saj255] yes it is!... I luckily read the website and they tell you to bring gum boots or old shoes... so I just tossed mine out...lol[http://www.flickr.com/photos/snapsforgeisha] That was lucky - we stumbled across it  by accident and it was raining on and off the whole day.  Very pretty spot though.  we are in Hobart for 2 more days but hopefully will have some shots to upload when I get home!I would be in heaven there!
Lovely shot.
