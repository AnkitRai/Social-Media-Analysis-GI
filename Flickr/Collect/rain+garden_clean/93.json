It took a long time to stir up the courage to nix the box hedge. I had no allies. Nick didn't want to; the tree trimmers even refused. &quot;Why would you want to do that?&quot; the tree trimmer asked. Plunging ahead with such an unpopular move required more subterfuge. I called the trimmers out to prune an acacia in the back, then said they couldn't do it because of nesting birds, but they could earn their fee if they removed the hedge. They fired up their buzz saws. Nick later concurred that it looked much better and even the tree trimmers agreed. I was incredibly relieved. If it had been a mistake, there might have been a garden war crimes trial. I later wrote about it for the Times and a sharp eyed Santa Monica designer said that she thought the whole tradition of foundation hedges was inextricably linked to lawn. Once I'd lost the lawn, the foundation hedge was the logical next edit.
