<b>THANKS FOR SHARING</b></b></a>Wow! No matter what season of the year you take picture of your garden, it's always beautiful! I wish you live not far from Somerset so I can visit and enjoy your beautiful garden. You and Mary really worked hard to achieve the garden you have now, simply stunning!delightful with the running streamLovely photo. Who needs sunshine when you have a glowing garden.Absolutely gorgeous!  What beautiful water feature!Absolutely exquisite.  That wonderful stream has always impressed me so greatly . . . and to think it has never leaked and is every bit as functional as it is beautiful.  And a garden in the rain is a rather romantic image . . . sometimes that's when they look best.  Perhaps you can encourage a bit of that rain to head this way . . . !I saw your beautiful work in:
