Nice comp and colors.[http://www.flickr.com/photos/kjkmep] 
Thanks Ken:-)[http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdub1980] I spent some time in among the redwoods there at the California / Oregon coast about 6 years ago. Incredible experience!Love the vibrant earthy colors. I haven't been to Muir Woods in over 2 years.  Time for me to go back![http://www.flickr.com/photos/send_your_spam] 
Thanks Lorenzo. Your beautiful shots from Henry Cowell Redwoods park, especially the most recent one on facebook titled &quot;Grand Defunct Railroad was awesome! dude you definitely gotta go back to Muir Woods and shoot, let me know and ill meet you. i hope to visit again soon and spend more time searching for unique compositions.  Since i had my daughter with me during this shoot, i made haste considering i was competing with a toddlers attention span lol. Im really proud of this shot, it was one of those compositions that jumped out in front of me. the light was just right and the color was nicely subdued due to the faint warm light and drizzle of sunset. Im happy the way the image looks on flickr in comparison to facebook.[http://www.flickr.com/photos/kjkmep] Ken thats awesome! i love the california coast, i have yet to explore Oregon's coast but that may change this  coming summer hopefully. Did you shoot any images while you were among the redwoods and the cali/oregon coast? i would love to see them. I definitely encourage you taking another trip west and visiting the Redwoods and California coast. If you head this way, drop me a line and maybe we could organize a meet and shoot :-)
Happy Easter!Great point of view and very convenient color composition. Well done. Enjoy your monday.Beautiful image with nice details and colors.[http://www.flickr.com/photos/matrix2305]  thank you very much. shooting at the right time of day and waiting for the perfect amount of light paid off in this one. im happy to showcase the beauty of the redwoods and Muir Woods National Monument[http://www.flickr.com/photos/78895422@N03]
