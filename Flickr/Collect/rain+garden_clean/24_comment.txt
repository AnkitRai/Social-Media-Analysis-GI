gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous.  I'll bet this smelled soooo good.
Lush, beautiful, rainy overcast surely yields some fine results as this one proves...
Just wonderful.
No I'm sorry to say.  So lush and colorful.
Rain (and cloud) makes for better color saturation (and aroma)!
not too bad....not toooo bad at all !  wow... dreamscape.com
I have not smelled wet lavender.  Something else to add to my bucket list.  Such beautiful layers of color in this shot.   I'm trying to imagine the fragrance.
Oh please...take me back to summer!
Beautiful natural saturation.
I've never even seen this much lavender in one location and I'm ready to get heady...lavender is such an old, nostalgic fragrance...wish I was you today...LOL
Your pictures and descriptions always make me want to be right there!
Amazing. As fine as any painting hanging in a museum.
Wow, this flower patch is really pretty - lavender is it?  Elements of this look &quot;pointilistic&quot; a la Seurat.
Beautiful!
As much as I'm tempted to smell (and shoot) wet lavender... I find that rain-drops on my lens are quite irritating! :)
Amazingly beautiful photo!
Wonderful --  First still photography  then  Video photography Maybe  NEXT   Aroma photography.
