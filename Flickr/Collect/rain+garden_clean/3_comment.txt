Congratulations on the successful recent visits. The garden is just wonderful in this photograph. Good luck this weekend!
I think this is my favorite part of your garden.  I love the stream and plantings.  These photos are treasures -- I especially like the one of Marie using the tilling equipment.  You have both invested so much of your time and energy and love into creating Four Seasons Garden -- what a satisfying feeling it must be.
