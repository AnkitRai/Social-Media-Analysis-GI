Very nice compositionAhh, just smell the moist soil. Plants always look so happy after a little burst of rain.The colors and contrasts here just could not be better ... great photo!The amazing thing to me about this masterpiece of a garden is its ability to appear incredibly beautiful from virtually any angle. Your plant selection and placement are truly stellar. What a rare and brilliant accomplishment. I am impressed and inspired!
