Beautiful Isabella! looks like a painting...
Isabella, your garden is lovely, you must enjoy seeing every flower in bloom!  Love the composition, rainy mood and everything! :)
I'm sorry for your beautiful garden :( I hope pass soon:-) Bye
Nice Capture ! And very relaxing garden ! I love the Terracota Pot !
Very well presented shot of part of what looks to be a beautiful garden - I'll bet that water soon causes erosion!
ein schnes Gartenbild LG
So good to feel happy about rain! Love it, too.
The DAvis Falls are great and so is the garden.  A lovely rainy day -- <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53726327@N03/"><i>Seen on your photo stream.</i></a> (<a href="http://red.trailr.info/red2.php?tlrv=10200000&amp;tlrurl=http://www.trailr.info" rel="nofollow"> <b>?</b> </a>)

Nice capture.
It must have been hard work to water the garden well before the rains came. I like the &quot;Davis Falls&quot;... it's quite spectacular :-)

[http://www.flickr.com/photos/gaensler] I wish he DID make some for the garden,I have personally considered going back the school and working in  large scale garden sculptures,the only way I will get what I want!. No Roy worked with metalsmith Ivan Bailey now in Monticello Georgia who also worked and studied for a year with a German metalsmith in Aachen . Many of the private garden gates here in Savannah were created with my husbands help. He was an apprentice with Ivan for three years in the late 70s and early 1980.Would love to see him at this craft once again! [http://www.flickr.com/photos/lumog37] thank you Lucas!

I love this shot. We had what felt like a monsoon a couple of weeks ago. Nothing quite like this though.
stunning photo :)
Simply fantastic and the colour is so beautiful..................big big compliments.....a happy weekend my friend !!!!!!!!!
wonderful romantic garden.....love it !!!!!!!
I am jealous of your rain, Isabella.  Oh how we need that here!  Your garden looks so gorgeous too, certainly it is loving it!
what an absolutely lovely garden. it's obvious that your talents w/ photography extend to your gardening as well. Lots of hard work goes in to making a garden such as yours. phone shots work too and this one works exceptionally well.
