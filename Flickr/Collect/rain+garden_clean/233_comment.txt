gardening does build character...and equanimity.

your gardening year so far sounds like our gardening year last summer. last year was a great year for greens, cool weather crops, onions, apples, and wild mushrooms. it is too soon to tell if we will be repeating any of it this summer, but our first csa pickup was a week earlier than last year, which is a good sign.

we are talking a somewhat conservative approach so far to planting this season, mostly due to the building of our garden fence and the opening of beds. so the only things i hope to eat much of by the end of the summer are garlic, shallots, onions, tomatoes, blueberries, &amp; rhubarb. 

next spring we will plant the permanent asparagus &amp; raspberry beds. and then go from there...

as my gardener friend dan says, &quot;with gardening it's always something&quot;. a good metaphor for other endeavors as well, i think.

here's to better gardening years, risa.I love gardening and know what you mean as mother nature is completely unpredictable. Sometimes I think it's smarter to not garden as much (@ our previous farm we had a 2 + acre garden) and make even more use of wild edibles of all kinds.

The typical &quot;extreme variety&quot; of foods seen on supermarket shelves isn't really attainable. Man was a bit more minimalist and made use of what he had and wasn't as extravagant or diverse in his palette as modern man. 

Right now we are getting very very hot and dry.... lol
Yes, it's always something isn't it?! : P

Great pic and detailed explanations. Even so, you've done well! : )
~W~Gardening is HARD!The favas, apples, and kale will keep you hale and hearty.  It's too bad about your favorites though.Thanks, everyone. Today: SUNNY! We don't feel like it has been this sunny since mid-April (when there was a 27F freeze). I am putting in the last beans and corn.
