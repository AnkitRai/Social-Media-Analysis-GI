Also known as the \u201cSpiral Garden\u201d project.  This project was spearheaded by Associate Professor Jim Wasley of the UWM School of Architecture and Urban Planning, as one of the first steps in a long term plan to drastically reduce stormwater discharge from the UWM campus.  Final design plans were by Arnold &amp; O\u2019Sheridan and are publically available through the State of Wisconsin Division of State Facilities.  I\u2019ve uploaded a couple of the most relevant site plans.  The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) provided partial project funding.    There is much more information online about this project, on the uwm.edu site and elsewhere, if you search for it.  \n   Some of the current (as of October 2012) bing.com \u201cbirds eye aerial views\u201d of this location show the project area just after construction.  You can see that the grading and hardscape features have just been constructed, but the bioretention areas are bare of plants.  The bing photos are probably from late 2009.  Notice how lush the vegetation has become in my photos from 2011.  Interestingly, some of the Bing birds eye views appear to show the project location before construction, when it was just an open grassed area (depending upon your zoom level and direction of viewing in Bing).  This project is located southwest of the intersection of Downer Ave. and Newport Ave.  in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.  The Klotsche Center and Sabin Hall are immediately north of the site and Holton Hall is to the south.\n"},"visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1350578558","taken":"2011-09-12 18:13:41","takengranularity":"0","takenunknown":0,"lastupdate":"1380639244"},"views":"1417","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":1,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":1},"comments":{"_content":"0"},"notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"87274828-8100266418-2590362","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"bioswale","_content":"bioswale","machine_tag":0},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-15338","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"Milwaukee","_content":"milwaukee","machine_tag":false},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-150677","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"BMP","_content":"bmp","machine_tag":false},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-119507","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"drainage","_content":"drainage","machine_tag":0},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-3465573","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"MMSD","_content":"mmsd","machine_tag":0},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-5007376","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"bioretention","_content":"bioretention","machine_tag":false},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-612846","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"rain garden","_content":"raingarden","machine_tag":false},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-192242","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"UWM","_content":"uwm","machine_tag":0},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-376253","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"UW-Milwaukee","_content":"uwmilwaukee","machine_tag":0},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-1638270","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee","_content":"universityofwisconsinmilwaukee","machine_tag":0},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-10572508","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"best management practice","_content":"bestmanagementpractice","machine_tag":0},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-68448474","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"zero discharge","_content":"zerodischarge","machine_tag":0},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-71413","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"SUDS","_content":"suds","machine_tag":0},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-8837038","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"green infrastructure","_content":"greeninfrastructure","machine_tag":false},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-1415963","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"Lot 18","_content":"lot18","machine_tag":0},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-5247119","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"Spiral Garden","_content":"spiralgarden","machine_tag":0},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-157389","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"stormwater","_content":"stormwater","machine_tag":false},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-50861057","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"bioinfiltration","_content":"bioinfiltration","machine_tag":0},{"id":"87274828-8100266418-12862258","author":"87297882@N03","authorname":"Aaron Volkening","raw":"Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District","_content":"milwaukeemetropolitanseweragedistrict","machine_tag":0}]},"location":{"latitude":"43.078778","longitude":"-87.879145","accuracy":"16","context":"0","neighbourhood":{"_content":"Downer Woods","place_id":".7eOHpFTW7j56cvRYw","woeid":"29230134"},"locality":{"_content":"Milwaukee","place_id":"ZE_bPoJTVr.4isrR","woeid":"2451822"},"county":{"_content":"Milwaukee","place_id":"Rap5SrNQUL.l1mYafA","woeid":"12590574"},"region":{"_content":"Wisconsin","place_id":"3cBQPq9TUb6FvPAL","woeid":"2347608"},"country":{"_content":"United States","place_id":"nz.gsghTUb4c2WAecA","woeid":"23424977"},"place_id":".7eOHpFTW7j56cvRYw","woeid":"29230134"},"geoperms":{"ispublic":1,"iscontact":0,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage","_content":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/87297882@N03\/8100266418\/"}]},"media":"photo"},"stat":"ok"}
