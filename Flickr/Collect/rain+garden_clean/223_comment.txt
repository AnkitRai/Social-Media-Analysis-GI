this is a really nice view of the landscaping for the F&amp;G festival. it looks like it was pouring!!
Even looks good in the rain.
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/iggbees] i actually think it was clearing up! i have a lot of good FG shots from the monorail, ill post them later on   [http://www.flickr.com/photos/fab05] thanks!
I was sooooooo hoping for this kind of weather in June when we were there. We were not lucky. Instead it was hot. 104 the day we left Epcot to head home. I couldn't believe it was that hot.
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/57509504@N04] thats why i normally try to avoid the parks during summer. the crowds as well, of course. but since im gonna be up there on business a few times the next couple of weeks, ill be having to brave the heat and the crowds...and.....weekends... *shudders*
I think springtime for F&amp;GF or fall for Halloween Party/F&amp;WF are the two best times....weather wise. December is good if it isn't too cold and you get the Christmas party/parade.
I think we are all familiar with a sight like this in the Florida parks. :) It's no good for picture taking, but way good for getting attractions done if you are brave enough to roam the parks in the rain. That used to be our favorite part about going in the summer, was the mass exit of many guests when it would start raining. :) Great shot!
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/57509504@N04] yea i try to avoid summer AT ALL costs!  [http://www.flickr.com/photos/dishippy] unfortunately, a lot more people come prepared for the rain than when i was a child...i remember then NO ONE had anything buy a yellow mickey poncho. and my dad would always hold out for at least an hour of rain before he bought them, because we had like 5 sets at home haha
Great angle and timing to capture this little slice of the IF&amp;GF heaven.  The dark treatment combined with the dramatic sky really make the flower designs pop.
