Im a second-year graduate student pursuing Master of City Planning, with the concentration of Urban Design. Last semester, we had a course called Urban Design and Research Methods. The professor, Stefan Al, asked us to collect good urban design works. So with the endeavor of the whole class, we collected 45 works and we are hoping to publish a small book to show all these excellent works in a Patent Style. The Rain Garden in Parking Lot is considered a great urban design idea. We are hoping to incorporate it in the book, but we need to use the photo above, so Im writing to you to ask if we can use this photo.  Thank you very much for supporting our Urban Design Patent Book. I look forward to hearing from you! And my email address is mengcao@design.upenn.edu.  Sincerely,  Meng Cao\n"], ["Great garden design.
