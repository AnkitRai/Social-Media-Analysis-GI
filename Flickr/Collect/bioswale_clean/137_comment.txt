Is the curb on the street side cut to allow street water to flow into the bioswale?  Also, is the sidewalk graded to direct water to the channels?  

I don't think their bioswale has to survive winters/significant snow and ice/salt; must be nice to be Oregon.So I forgot to get a photo of that, but according to <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/bes/index.cfm?c=47012&amp;a=203152" rel="nofollow">this brochure from Portland</a>, water does enter from the street. 

I don't know if the sidewalk has a slope.

CDOT built a huge bioswale and permeable parking lot at Des Plaines north of Taylor Street. It's parking for the Maxwell Street Market. I have a photo but I haven't uploaded it yet.Don't you need flush kerbing to maximise permeability?  The idea is to facilitate stormwater flow to trap any chemicals/nutrients in the runoff before the water gets discharged off-sites into other drainage channels...@PSeangsong: Check the notes for details. The flush curbing is at the far end of the bioswale. I should have walked all around it to get better photos as this is the first neighborhood, small-scale bioswale I've ever seen in person.My sons' school has a bioswale. Until this time, I did not know this type of management had a name.
